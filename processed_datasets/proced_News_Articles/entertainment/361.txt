super size me director morgan spurlock has won the writers guild of americas award for documentary feature writing
the oscarnominated film followed spurlock as he ate only mcdonalds fast food for an entire month
spurlock was given the award at a special ceremony at the roosevelt hotel in hollywood on tuesday
organisers said the rising popularity of documentary films led them to honour a writer for a documentary screenplay for the first time
producer brian grazer presented the award to spurlock and the films backers roadside attractions samuel goldwyn films and showtime independent films
spurlock set out to discover the effect of living on nothing but mcdonalds for a month upgrading to supersize portions when offered
the film followed his 25lb weight gain and the health effects on his body including his liver and cholesterol levels
mcdonalds announced it was to scrap its supersized meals last year but denied the move was as a result of the negative publicity created by spurlocks film
spurlock was given his award on the same day the european court of human rights ruled that two uk activists should have been given legal aid in their long fight against a mcdonalds libel action
helen steel and david morris from north london dubbed the mclibel two were found guilty in a 1990s trial of libelling the company in a leaflet they had been handing out at the end of the case the high court in london ruled mcdonalds had been libelled and awarded the company £60000 in damages later reduced to £40000 on appeal
but he found the leaflet was true in some aspects
