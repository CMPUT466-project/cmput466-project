ticket sales at the us box office are predicted to break records this year with figures expected to reach 94 billion beating 2002s alltime high
overall figures could be dampened by the lack of a christmas hit like last years oscarwinning lord of the rings
traditionally ticket sales during the festive season account for 20 of the annual total
although admissions have actually fallen this year the predicted high is down to increasing ticket prices
according to exhibitor relations president paul dergarabedian the average cost of a cinema ticket could be as high as 625 in 2004 compared to 580 in 2002
this year some of the biggest hits such as the passion of the christ and fahrenheit 911 came from outside the major studios which are usually responsible for the key blockbusters
many of the films that did well with audiences are not necessarily the films that made a lot of money said mr dergarabedian
he added that surprise hits had come from some of the more arthouse offerings such as napoleon dynamite and critical hit sideways
sony pictures responsible for hits like spiderman 2 and the grudge are expected to top domestic market share for the second time in three years with 1 billionplus in sales for the third consecutive year
sony pictures entertainment vice chairman
jeff blake said we had a really diverse slate this year and
certainly we pulled off one of the surprises with grudge horror movie the grudge cost sony 10 million to make but brought in 110 million
its the latest in a recent trend for hollywood studios to back the upper and lower ends of the market whilst ignoring the middle
warner inc are likely to end the year in second place on market share with around 125 billion with disney at number three
