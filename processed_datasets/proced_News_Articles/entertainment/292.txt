preview performances of the Â£3m musical billy elliot have been delayed to give the child actors a less arduous rehearsal schedule
director stephen daldry made the decision to reschedule the previews to protect the young stars
three boys will rotate the demanding role of ballet dancer billy which requires them to sing dance and act
the shows opening night on 12 may at the victoria palace theatre in london remains unaffected by the changes
preview performances will now be held on 14 20 and 27 april
this is one of the most ambitious projects i have been involved with said daldry
the decision has been made to push back our preview performances in order to give our company with a cast including 45 children a little extra time so they are as fully prepared as possiblehe added the young billy elliots in particular making their professional stage debuts in the west end will benefit from a little extra time to familiarise themselves with all aspects of the productionthe three boys playing billy are james lomas 15 george maguire 14 and liam mower 12
the other major child parts will also be rotated between young actors
such are the demands of the show that producers set up a stage school in newcastle to train potential stars for the show
child labour laws also mean the young actors can only work for a limited period each week
adult actors in the show include tim healy as billys father and haydn gwnne as his dance teacher mrs wilkinson
sir elton john has composed the music
daldry directed the successful film version of billy elliot adapted from lee halls script
both were nominated for oscars alongside julie walters who played billys teacher
