movie monster godzilla has received a star on hollywoods walk of fame honouring both his 50th birthday and the launch of his 28th film
an actor dressed as the giant creature breathed smoke over photographers on monday as godzilla received the 2271st star on hollywood boulevard
godzilla should thank you for this historical and monumental star said final wars producer shogo tomiyama
but unfortunately he cannot speak english he added
hollywoods honorary mayor johnny grant said i do hereby proclaim this godzilla day in hollywood
hes loose hes wild and im getting the hell out of here he added
the premiere of godzilla final wars at graumans chinese theatre followed the ceremony on hollywood boulevard
the monster was joined by costars including japanese pop star and actor masahiro matsuoka
director ryuhei kitamura said it may not be godzillas final outing as it has been billed
thats what the producers say
but the producers a liar he said
godzillas been working for the last 50 years
so i think godzilla just deserves a vacation and producer shogo tomiyama added so long as godzilla can fascinate people i believe he will be resurrected by new generations of filmmakers in the future godzilla first appeared in 1954 as a prehistoric lizard woken by atomic bomb tests
