she and john mccririck faced the public vote on friday  67 of people voted to keep the racing pundit in the house
stallone 71 appeared not to have enjoyed her time in the house saying im a total wreck i need a vacation this was a nightmare
but she was pleased to have patched things up with actress brigitte nielsen her former daughterinlaw
that alone was worth 1m she said
stallone joined the channel 4 show on monday as a surprise for nielsen
she was hot favourite to be evicted first with odds of 14 to leave
but mccririck has made some enemies with his outspoken views about women
ladbrokes spokesman warren lush said we may have underestimated the power of the antimccririck brigade but its so hard to call with him there are people out there who either love him or hate him there is no middle ground the bookmakers have made former happy mondays dancer bez favourite to win the show at 74 while blazin squad singer kenzie is second at 21
bez has wooed the viewers and looks the one to beat hes kept his nose clean and doesnt take anything too seriously mr lush said

feminist icon germaine greer quit the show earlier in the week over what she called bullying tactics used by the programmes producers
