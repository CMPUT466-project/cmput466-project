director oliver stones historical epic alexander has failed in its bid to conquer the box office entering the us film charts at number six
the swords and sandals blockbuster rumoured to have cost more than 150m £79m to make earned just 135 £7m over three days at the us box office
due to the thanksgiving holiday the film opened on wednesday bringing its total takings to 216m £114m
top of the box office for a second week was action movie national treasure
the family adventure starring nicolas cage took 331m £17m ahead of animated comedy the incredibles  now in its fourth week in the charts  which took 241m £127m
last week oliver stones film met with scathing reviews from us critics
the film stars irish actor colin farrell as one of historys most celebrated leaders  a relentless and arrogant warrior who conquered much of the known world by the age of 25
in particular its portrayal of alexander as a bisexual has met with a hostile reception and the threat of legal action from greek lawyers
though the battles have the bloodandsinew bravado you expect from oliver stone this threehour buttnumbathon is hamstrung by a hectoring grandiosity wrote one reviewer in rolling stone magazine
others poured scorn on farrells bleached hair and angelina jolies unwieldy accent which variety called a combination of mata hari and count dracula 
but novelist gore vidal defended the film saying it was barrierbreaking for its frank depiction of bisexuality
in sweden last thursday to pick up a lifetime achievement award at the stockholm international film festival stone expressed the hope that alexander might be better appreciated in europe
one of the reasons i am being honoured here is europeans tend to see me a little differently than they do in the us said the director behind jfk platoon and born on the fourth of july
he added alexander was not an easy movie but then ive never made easy movies
