us rap star 50 cent has said he has thrown protege the game out of his gunit gang in a feud that has apparently involved two shootings
in a radio interview on monday 50 cent said the newcomer was disloyal in conflicts with other rappers
a man was shot in the thigh outside new yorks hot 97 studios while 50 cent was on air
more shots were fired outside his management offices two hours later
50 cent appeared on the games debut album which was number one in the us
50 cent whose second album is about to be released after his debut made him one of hiphops biggest stars has been involved in recent rivalries with fellow artists including fat joe nas and jadakiss
he has claimed credit for the success of the game who has become the hottest new star on the rap scene
both were drug dealers and were shot before turning to music
in an interview with hot 97 on saturday the game described some of 50 cents rivals as my friends and said he would not turn on them
nas is one of my friends and jadas really a homie he said
50s beef is 50s beef and i really dont know where all this stems from when 50 cent appeared on the same station two days later he said the game was no longer a member of gunit
every record hes selling is based on me being on his record with him he said
when the shooting took place outside the studio the interview was ended and the rapper was escorted out of the building by security personnel
an unidentified 24yearold los angeles man is stable with a gunshot wound to the upper thigh
police say the games associates may have heard the interview and gone to the studio where they confronted 50 cents entourage
officers are also investigating a later shooting in which eight bullets were fired into the door of 50 cents management company violator
no arrests have been made in relation to either incident
50 cents second album the massacre is released on thursday five weeks after the games debut documentary went to number one
elliott wilson editorinchief of hiphop magazine xxl said the feud would boost publicity for 50 cents release
it helps him obviously in terms of exposure
you cant ask for better promotion he said
but he added i think hes making more and more enemies
you definitely feel like is he doing too much of a tupac spiral like me against the world
you bring more people wanting to see you fail tupac shakur was shot dead in 1996
