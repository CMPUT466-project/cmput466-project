some of elvis presleys earliest recordings  including takes of all shook up  are going under the hammer on sunday at a los angeles auction
the six unedited reeltoreel tapes  which were owned by the engineer who recorded them  are valued at up to 50000 Â£29000
highlights of the two hourlong collection will get their public debut at bonhams auction house on saturday
the rca tapes date from september 1956 to september 1957
the premasters include a take of jailhouse rock religious songs material for his first christmas album and banter between presley members of his band and engineer thorne nogar
weve had them for a lot of years and i think the people should enjoy them nogars son stephen 57 said
and frankly we could use the money nogar who died in 1994 aged 72 always used to make two tapes of sessions as a backup in case rca producers wanted to make late changes to songs
he called them his asssaver tapes his son said
the quality is said to be noticeably crisper than that of a new vinyl record
because the family does not own the copyright to the music the tapes can only be sold for personal enjoyment and they cannot be copied for commercial gain
