a lowbudget horror film produced by evil dead director sam raimi has topped the north american box office
boogeyman which focuses on a man who returns to his childhood home to confront his traumatic past took 195m £149m in three days
last weeks charttopper the robert de niro thriller hide and seek fell to number four
other new entries included the wedding date a comedy starring will and graces debra messing at number two
the roadtrip comedy are we there yet and multiple oscar nominee million dollar baby completed the top five
other oscar contenders including the aviator and sideways continued to perform strongly at the box office
the aviator has taken 75m £40m so far while sideways has taken 468m £248m in a more limited release
boogeyman which cost just 7m £35m to make performed well even though it was not screened to critics before release  normally a sign that a film will get bad reviews or perform poorly at the box office
i certainly believe its a genre where people are going to be more moved by the marketing materials for the movie than by what the critics say said rory bruer head of distribution for sony pictures which released the film in the us
overall the weekend box office was strong despite the fact that it was american footballs super bowl weekend  a time when cinema admissions generally fall
this year the top 12 films grossed around 91m £483m compared to 2004s super bowl weekend when the total box office was 734m £389m
