the plot of an international bestseller that thousands of readers are likely to receive as a christmas present is laughable a clergyman has said
the da vinci code claims jesus was not crucified but married mary magdalene and died a normal death
it claims this was later covered up by the church
the bishop of durham the rt rev dr tom wright described the novel as a great thriller but lousy history
the book has sold more than seven million copies worldwide
despite enjoying dan browns conspiracy theory the bishop said there was a lack of evidence to back up its claims
writing his christmas message in the northern echo the bishop said conspiracy theories are always fun  fun to invent fun to read fun to fantasise about
dan brown is the best writer ive come across in the genre but anyone who knows anything about 1st century history will see that this underlying material is laughable a great deal of credible evidence proves the biblical version of jesus life was true according to the bishop
the evidence for jesus and the origins of christianity is astonishingly good he said
we have literally a hundred times more early manuscripts for the gospels and letters in the new testament than we have for the main classical authors like cicero virgil and tacitus
historical research shows that they present a coherent and thoroughly credible picture of jesus with all sorts of incidental details that fit the time when he lived and dont fit the world of later legend browns book has become a publishing phenomenon consistently topping book charts in the uk and us
the da vinci code has been translated into 42 languages and has spawned its own cottage industry of publications including guides on to how to read the book rebuttals and counter claims
the book which has become an international bestseller in little over two years is set to be made into a film starring tom hanks

but the organisers of the play say it raises awareness of sexual abuse against women
the play promotes illegal unnatural sexual acts homosexuality and prostitution it should be and is hereby banned the councils ruling said
the show which has been a controversial sellout around the world explores female sexuality and strength through individual women telling their stories through monologues
some parliamentarians and church leaders are also siding with the media council ugandas new vision newspaper reports
the play is obscene and pornographic although it was under the guise of womens liberation mp kefa ssempgani told parliament
but the works author us playwright eve ensler says it is all about womens empowerment
there is obviously some fear of the vagina and saying the word vagina ms ensler told the bbc
its not a slang word or dirty word its a biological anatomical word she said the play is being produced and performed by ugandan women and it is not being forced on them
the four ugandan ngos organising the play intended to raise money to campaign to stop violence against women and to raise funds for the wartorn north of the country
im extremely outraged at the hypocrisy the plays organiser in uganda sarah mukasa told the bbcs focus on africa programme
im amazed that this country uganda gives the impression that it is progressive and supports womens rights and the notions of free speech yet when women want to share their stories the government uses the apparatus of state to shut us up

born in luton bedfordshire on 5 april 1920 hailey was the only child of working class parents they could not afford to keep him in school beyond the age of 14
he served as a pilot with the royal air force during world war ii flying fighter planes to the middle east
it was an occupation that was later to feature in his authorial debut the television screenplay flight into danger
hailey emigrated to canada in 1947 where he eventually became a citizen
he wanted to be a writer from an early age but did not take it up professionally until his midthirties when he was inspired to write his first screenplay while on a return flight to toronto
i fell to daydreaming
i visualised the pilots at the controls and wondered what would happen if they both got sick
could i fly the airplane i was a rusty wartime pilot who hadnt flown for nine years
 hailey later recalled
the canadian broadcasting corporation bought flight into danger for 600 £318 and it was shown on tv in april 1956
it was later memorably spoofed in the 1980 comedy airplane starring leslie nielsen

i have never been able to write quickly or easily
i am too selfcritical for that
i am never satisfied he once said
in 1969 he moved to nassau in the bahamas with his wife sheila
wheels 1971 the moneychangers 1975 and overload 1979 followed
despite a lukewarm response from critics and few literary accolades hailey was at the height of his fame in the seventies and continued to attract the attention of hollywood producers

the 1997 novel detective proved to be haileys final book when at the age of 77 he decided to retire
haileys health began to deteriorate in recent years twice undergoing heart surgery
he suffered a stroke just two months ago
he died in his sleep on wednesday after dinner with his wife and two of his six children at his home in new providence island

the tate gallery unsuccessfully tried to buy the picture from its anonymous owner after a ban was issued preventing the painting from leaving the uk

portrait of omai fetched the second highest amount for a british painting when it was sold at auction for £103m in 2001
it was bought by a london dealer who sold it on to a collector
the unnamed collector wanted to take it out of the country but was barred from doing so by the government because of its historical significance
in march 2004 the tate managed to raise £125m funding to buy the portrait but the owner refused to sell and it has been held in storage since
the portrait is of a young man who was dubbed the noble savage when he arrived in london from polynesia
he became a darling of london society and was invited to all the best parties by people who were fascinated by such an exotic character

dame alicia markova who has died in bath aged 94 was the uks first prima ballerina of the modern age and in her heyday the greatest in the western world
she was born lilian alicia marks in london in 1910
her parents were comfortably off  her father a mining engineer drove a rolls royce
when she was eight her mother took a decision which changed her life
fearing that she had flat feet and weak legs she arranged for her to have ballet lessons
very quickly it became apparent that she was something special
she was spotted by the russian artistic impresario sergei diaghilev who wanted her to dance for his company ballets russes
she became ill with diphtheria but kept in touch and eventually with a governess in tow joined diaghilev in monte carlo when she was 14
from here she toured europe playing in all the top venues
it was diaghilev who changed her name without even consulting her
her life was one of great excitement
people such as matisse and stravinsky became like uncles to her the latter put in charge of her musical education
soon after diaghilevs death in 1929 alicia markova returned to england and became britains first international ballerina
she helped launch the ballet club at the mercury theatre later the ballet rambert the vic wells ballet and then with anton dolin the markovadolin ballet of 193537
she also began working with young choreographers such as anthony tudor and frederick ashton who became huge influences on the direction of ballet in the west
her version of giselle all lightness and grace is still considered to be among the finest ever
she was also outstanding in the dying swan
she was one of the first british ballerinas to take a major part in les sylphides
she above all helped popularise ballet both in britain and in america
alicia markova spent world war ii in the united states where in a reformed ballets russes she played to huge audiences
she even appeared in hollywood movies
in 1950 back in england she and anton dolin jointly established the festival ballet
she retired in 1963 an instant decision she said largely because of a leg injury
created a dame she made a new career for herself as a teacher
she also travelled the world directing ballet companies and putting on shows
she became director of ballet for the metropolitan opera ballet in new york and for some years was fulltime professor of ballet and performing arts in the university of cincinnati
a critic once said of dame alicia markovas dancing she gave the illusion of moving as if she had no weight to get off the ground
fewer children in the uk are following in the dainty footsteps of dancers like darcey bussell and carving out potential careers as ballet dancers
new research from the royal academy of dance rad has found fewer children over the age of 10 are attending ballet classes and taking exams in the discipline
the organisation blames the growing popularity of computer games and other changes in lifestyle
and there are fears that if the trend is not reversed there could be fewer british ballet stars in the future
the rad found that the number of youngsters taking their ballet exams drops by almost 70 after the age of 10 or 11
dance teacher eve trew who has taught ballet for over 48 years told bbc news she had seen a vast change over the years
she blamed modern lifestyles for the fall in ballet attendance
i think the children of many years ago did not have as many hobbies she said
the trouble now is that they are wide open to computers gameboys and everything else children have got
as a result there is less time being spent on ballet lessonshazel gilbert 23 an information manager from newcastle gave up ballet at the age of 10 and is typical of the problem
its not a very cool thing to do when you go to big school and i think you have to be very focused on ballet to want to carry on doing it she said
i used to love it but after a certain age it becomes much more disciplined and i didnt want that
i started getting into other things like swimming and kickboxing and ballet just wasnt something i wanted to do any more ms trew who runs a dance school in gateshead admitted it would be very difficult to reverse the trend and said many young ballet dancers were no longer willing to make the sacrifices to succeed
you have to be very dedicated and you have to be very disciplined
it is a career that you have got to really want to do because it is such hard work
children these days have not got the time to spend perfecting it
that is very sadcurrently only two out of 16 principal dancers at the royal ballet  darcey bussell and jonathan cope  are british compared to 16 of the 21 principals in 1985
but a spokesman for the english national ballet told bbc news that although only two out of their 12 principal dancers were british around a quarter of the companys dancers were from the uk
he said competition at open auditions in london was fierce between talented dancers from all over the world
the rad have launched a new competition to try and reverse the decline in british ballet
dame antoinette sibley president of the rad launched the fonteyn nureyev young dancers competition earlier this week
aimed at children aged 10 to 13 it is hoped the contest will help keep british ballet evolving
a spokeswoman for the rad said it is our responsibility to reignite the passion and nurture young dancers for the longterm future of ballet
we need to provide them with a framework and a goal to work towards with constant support and coaching in an environment where they can work with their peers and possibly leading artists and choreographers
perhaps more importantly provide them with the opportunity to experience performance themselves
what better way to reignite a passion for ballet than to let them experience the thrill of performance

lily tucks the news from paraguay is a fictionalised tale about paraguayan leader francisco solano lopez and his irish mistress
but the annual awards which were presented in new york on wednesday were not without controversy
childrens author judy blume who was given an honourary medal used the ceremony to speak out over censorship
sales of blumes books have exceeded 75 million but her work  which features frank narratives about families religion and sexuality  is closely watched by the censors
blume said the urge to ban is contagious
it spreads like wildfire from community to community
please speak out
censors hate publicity her medal marks the second year in a row the honourary prize went to someone as notable for popular success as literary greatness
last years honorary winner stephen king accused the industry during the 2003 ceremony of snobbery against popular writers
but his argument that the award should help sell books instead of honouring excellence is not shared by everyone
this years fiction panel overlooked highprofile works such as philip roths the plot against america and instead chose five littleknown books all by new yorkbased women
one fiction judge stewart onan carried around a note written on a napkin that said i would hope that our caring more for the quality of a work than its sales figures make us a friend of books not an enemy the national book awards nonfiction prize was awarded to kevin boyles for arc of justice which focuses on a black familys fight to live in a white detroit neighbourhood in the 1920s

the national gallery home to some of the uks greatest artworks has seen a big jump in visitor numbers
five million visitors made the london gallery  which houses treasures like raphaels madonna of the pinks  the uks most visited museum in 2004
it recorded a 138 rise in numbers and was the countrys second most visited tourist attraction behind blackpool pleasure beach
charles saumarez smith the gallerys director said he was delighted
he said the number of visitors through the doors had boosted figures to pre11 september 2001 levels
mr saumarez smith added that the pedestrianisation of trafalgar square where the gallery is located and strong temporary collections throughout 2004 had led to the strong performance
our 2004 exhibition programme of el greco russian landscape in the age of tolstoy and raphael from urbino to rome was particularly strong and exceeded all targets he said
the exceptional quality of the paintings in our permanent collection is also huge draw for the public
the expectations of todays visitors are higher than ever and we have kept pace with their demands mr saumarez smith said he was confident the gallery could maintain the attendance
with important exhibitions of the work of caravaggio stubbs and rubens in place for 2005 i am confident that the gallery is set for another highly successful year he added
the figures were prepared by the association of leading visitor attractions alva
it found that the figures had been boosted by an increase in europeans travelling to the uk on budget airlines
popular cultural tourist spots such as the tate modern and the natural history museum all recorded increases of more than 10 in visitor numbers compared with 2003
but for legal or confidentiality reasons some alva members did not submit figures for 2004 including buckingham palace windsor castle madame tussauds and alton towers
alva director robin broke said visits from western europe were up by 10 and from north america by some 9 compared to 2003 while numbers from the rest of the world rose 20
european figures were helped by the rapid growth of lowcost flights to britain from europe especially from new eu countries

people do fall by the wayside and the more avenues we can provide for aspiring authors the better he added
paul cavanagh a former university professor and health care consultant from ontario in canada was one of 1466 aspiring novelists to enter the first contest
he lifted the inaugural lit idol prize after reading aloud an excerpt of his work northwest passage
three film studios are said to be interested in buying film rights for the book even though it is not finished yet

harry potter director alfonso cuaron has signed a threeyear deal with hollywood studio warner brothers according to variety trade magazine
the mexican filmmaker who directed harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban will produce mainstream movies and smaller spanishlanguage films
we had a wonderful experience with alfonso on harry potter warner producer jeff robinov told variety
cuarons other films include mexican movie y tu mama tambien
the 2001 ritesofpassage drama about two teenage boys who embark on a relationship with an older woman brought cuaron international attention  and box office glory
it also won him and his brother carlos with whom he cowrote the screenplay an oscar nomination for best original screenplay
warner will distribute cuarons films in several languages outside the us
this deal will give us the opportunity to collaborate with alfonso on movies that make the most of his artistry and vision and continue to offer him the mainstream worldwide audiences that our studio provides so successfully said mr robinov
his first film for warner brothers was 1995s family fantasy movie a little princess
based on the novel by frances hodgson burnett a little princess tells the story of a young girl who is sent to live in a new york boarding school when her widowed father enlists for war
after the erotic nature of y tu mama tambien cuaron was a surprise choice to direct the third harry potter film but his dark interpretation was received well by the public and critics alike

a film based on the internet musings of the baghdad blogger has been shown at the rotterdam film festival
the film has been directed by the man who calls himself salam pax the author of the weblog about iraqi life during and after the war
the movie version comes in the form of a series of shorts made by pax on a handheld camera
baghdad blogger is among a number of films about iraq showcased at the dutch festival which runs until sunday
following the fascination with the writing of salam pax  not his real name  he began a regular column in the guardian newspaper and was given a crash course in documentary filmmaking
for the film he travelled iraq to document the changing landscape of the country and the problems it has faced since the invasion speaking to ordinary iraqis about their experiences
the festival will also see the screening of underexposure one of iraqs first features to emerge since the toppling of saddam hussein
director oday rasheed made the film on discarded 1980s kodak film taken from the remains for the former ministry of culture building
it centres on the lives of families and strangers going about their everyday business as baghdad is under siege
rasheed said the title was refers to the isolation felt by iraqis under saddams regime and the difficult time the country is now experiencing
saddams regime was hell but now i think the hell has doubled rasheed said

more than 14 million people saw dirty den watts killed off on friday marking eastenders 20th anniversary according to unofficial figures
dens death came 16 years after he was supposedly shot in 1989
but he came back to the show in september 2003
the audience for bbc ones onehour special averaged 137 million and peaked at 142 million in the last 15 minutes overnight figures showed
den died after being confronted by zoe chrissie and sam in the queen vic
if the ratings are confirmed the episode will have given the soap its highest audience for a year
the overnight figures showed almost 60 of the viewing public tuned into eastenders between 2000 and 2100 gmt leaving itv1 with about 13
we are very pleased with the figures a bbc spokesman said
it shows viewers have really enjoyed the story of dens demise the shows highest audience came at christmas 1986 when more than 30 million tuned in to see den played by leslie grantham hand divorce papers to wife angie
two years later 24 million saw him apparently shot by a man with a bunch of daffodils by a canal
more than 16 million viewers watched his return in 2003

despite sporting a corduroy cap pulled low over his face plus a pair of dark glasses robert redford cuts an unmistakable figure through the starstruck crowds at sundance
its a rare downtown appearance for the man who started the annual festival in park city utah back in the 1980s
now in its twentyfirst year sundance continues to grow
some 45000 people are estimated to have descended on this small ski town with nothing but movies on the mind
its an opportunity to meet and make deals
redford wanted sundance to be a platform for independent filmmakers but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream
smaller festivals like slamdance and xdance which take place during the same week in park city are competing for sundances limelight
but redford is not worried
the more the merrier he says
the point was to create opportunities for people who may not have them
once independent film had a place where the work could be seen suddenly the merchants came
with them the celebrities came then the paparazzi  and suddenly it began to take on a whole new tone explains redford
people started to say we had gone mainstream and hollywood but actually hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film he adds
international filmmakers have always been celebrated here but 2005 is the first year a dedicated world dramatic and documentary competition is being held
redford wants the festival to encompass viewpoints he believes the american media fails to reflect particularly how the us is perceived internationally
he has never hidden the fact that he is a democrat
but he reserves particular disdain for the current republican administration
its the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in a democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration he says
i think many voices are being shut down or accused of being unpatriotic if they want to express another point of view
thats very unhealthy and very dangerous
if we take that policy into the world there will be the same victims and the same consequences sundance isnt just one big screening
there are discussion panels and qa sessions with directors tackling controversial topics like americas culture wars and the iraq war
while redford wishes the festival to be a forum for dissent the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic
educated middle class and predominantly white americans comes sundance with views from the same end of the political spectrum  antiwar and socially liberal
but redford knows this and started the sundance tv channel in an effort to reach a wider audience
when you look at the films here what we are presenting is very much egalitarian
and its about good films and good storytelling be it african america asian women gay lesbian
sooner or later we will do away with those stereotypical labels and people will say its just a film by soand so
this third harry potter film brought a change of director and a dramatic visual shakeup that really shines on dvd
gone are the warm bright colours found in the two earlier films alfonso cuaron brings in a bleak and cold feel that is simply gorgeous  and looks even better here than in the cinema
it is all part of the progression of harrys story into darker areas but youll spend time just marvelling at the beautiful hogwarts landscape
this is the first potter film where you get so lost in the screen adaptation that you forget the book
it is the third year at hogwarts and studies are interrupted as they always are by a calamity that only harry ron and hermione can put right
it sounds corny
but harry is no longer the winsome hero he is a moody teenager and daniel radcliffe pulls it off very well
emma watson is ever better as hermione and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including gary oldman and emma thompson
the film itself is the reason to buy this dvd
but it is laden with behindthescenes extras including funny if shallow interviews with all the main cast
but what seems like a long list of features can be swiftly whittled down to the few that you are going to watch
younger viewers will go for the games which include a magic you may have missed memory test and crookshanks chasing off after scabbers
adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes
you will understand why they were deleted but it is fun to see more footage  and not have to hunt through endless menus to find it as we did on the first harry potter dvd
the most interesting pieces are an interview with jk rowling in creating the vision and conjuring a scene a short featurette about the making of the films big moments

hollywood star tom hanks was in londons leicester square for the uk premiere of polar express
the west end landmark was turned into a festive landscape complete with snow and carol singers to celebrate the arrival of the animated film
this is leicester square like youve never seen it before said hanks who plays five roles in the movie

hundreds of fans greeted the star all wearing santa hats and mince pies were on offer
hanks said that the new film has an elegant message
christmas is a special time of the year and you get out of it what you put into it added the twotime academy award winner
i believe in the spirit of christmas and i think thats embodied in santa claus he said

the performance capture technique enables hanks to play a number of roles including the eightyearold boy who is at the centre of the story and father christmas
it is directed by robert zemeckis who has previously worked with hanks on forrest gump and castaway

plans to portray dominicas carib indians as cannibals in the sequel to hit film pirates of the caribbean have been criticised by the groups chief
carib chief charles williams said talks with disneys producers revealed there was a strong element of cannibalism in the script which cannot be removed
the caribbean islands government said disney planned to film in dominica
the caribs have long denied their ancestors practised cannibalism
disney was unavailable for comment
our ancestors stood up against early european conquerors and because they stood upwe were labelled savages and cannibals up to today said mr williams
this cannot be perpetuated in movies shooting on the sequel is expected to begin in april with hundreds of dominicans applying to be extras in the movie
about 3000 caribs live on the island of dominica which has a population of 70000
many caribs were killed by disease and war during colonisation up to the 1600s
mr williams said he had received support from indigenous groups around the world in his efforts to have cannibalism references removed from the film
but he admitted there were some members of the carib council who did not support the campaign
he said some did not understand our history they are weak and are not committed to the cause of the carib people
the first pirates of the caribbean film took 305m £162m at the box office in the us alone
the cast and crew are to work on two sequels backtoback with the first to be released in 2006

the man who said he got oscarnominated movie the aviator off the ground and signed up leonardo dicaprio has been shut out of the academy awards race
charles evans jr battled over his role with the people who eventually made the film and won a producers credit
but he is not on the list of producers who can win a best film oscar due to a limit on the number of nominees
the oscars organisers have picked two of the aviators four producers to be nominated for best film
up to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind the aviator and million dollar baby failed to trim their credits  so the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences ampas has done it for them
the aviators nominated producers are michael mann and graham king  with mr evans and sandy climan mr manns former deputy left off
mr evans sued mr mann in 2001 claiming he came up with the idea spent years developing it and persuaded dicaprio to play hughes  but said he was later excluded from the project
the two sides settled out of court in a deal that has remained secret apart from the fact mr evans name has appeared as a producer when the films credits roll
at the golden globes mr evans  who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film  evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with dicaprio director martin scorsese mr mann and mr king
ampas decided to limit the number of producers who could be nominated after shakespeare in loves victory in 1999 saw five producers collect awards

producer mel gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote the passion of the christ to voters in next years academy awards
gibson and his icon productions partner bruce davey said they would not be campaigning in print radio or tv for success at the oscars in february
this film should be judged on its artistic merit not who spends more money on advertising davey said
but dvds will be sent to oscar voters who will be invited to screenings
icon spent very little on advertising the film which deals with the last hours of jesus christs life when it was released earlier this year  instead it made the film available for special screenings at churches
it went on to gross over 600m £322m in ticket sales worldwide
over recent years marketing films to the members of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences has become a multimillion dollar industry
last year the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios
academy president frank pierson praised gibsons move for working to restore the oscars as a celebration and appreciation of excellence and resisting the crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award

the release of a film about the mumbai bombay blasts in 1993 has been postponed following protests by those on trial for the bombings
investigating the blasts which killed more than 250 people and wounded 1000 the film black friday had been due to open across india on friday
but 36 people accused in connection with the blasts said it should not be screened until the trial is over
mumbai high court postponed the films launch until 3 february
black friday is based upon the novel of the same name written by journalist s hussain zaidi which looks at the 15 explosions which rocked mumbai on 12 march 1993
director anurag kashyap said the films release should not be delayed as the book has already been on sale for two years
if you have not gone against the book then how can you go against the movie mr kashyaps lawyer mihir desai said
this is the second time that those accused in connection with the blasts have sought legal intervention regarding the film
they previously asked that a line from the movies poster which claimed the film portrayed the true story of the bombay bomb blasts be removed
their lawyer majeed memon said we had argued that how can a film say it is telling the true story when the court itself is struggling to find the truth so we said they should remove the line from their promotional posters and they did give us an assurance that they would do so the mumbai bombings case is one of indias longestrunning trials
a special court was set up to hear the case and regular hearings have taken place there for the last nine years with more than six hundred witnesses questioned

youll have forgotten it all tomorrow but youll have a fun night with the film and all the extras
there is a onedisc version that has commentaries and a making of but the twodisc adds more
unusually for this kind of film the extras dont solely concentrate on the special effects
theyre covered but theres also a general production diary and a postproduction feature
remember the national lotterys draw machines arthur and guinevere they were more accurate than this glossy hollywood version of the tale
but as long as youre not expecting a documentary live with it king arthur is a fun exciting totally shallow experience and looks excellent
clive owen is the brooding king keira knightly rises above her costume and ray winstone gives it all some grit
its at its best in its battle scenes which are well done and are also the best part of the making of extra
less flashy than a david attenborough show and less detailed than a simon schama one the bbc series british isles nevertheless turned out to be quite engrossing
admit it the fact that this is one of the shows alan titchmarsh left ground force to present did mean that you expected something equally frothy
but titchmarsh turns out to know his subject and the sight of our presentday landscape being peeled back to reveal the past was fascinating

late film star marlon brando is said to have repeatedly turned down his oscarwinning role in the godfather
the actors friend budd schulberg told vanity fair magazine that brandos assistant suggested he read the novel
the actor repeatedly refused throwing the book at her and saying for the last time i wont glorify the mafia
but brando who died last july at the age of 80 eventually took the role of don corleone winning him an oscar in 1973 which he notoriously refused
the actor sent a young woman dressed in native american costume to refuse the award on his behalf and to draw attention to the plight of native americans
schulberg told the magazine that brandos assistant realised the film star had warmed to the idea of the godfather role when he sported a drawnon pencil moustache and asked how do i look his assistant alice marchak said that he looked like george raft an actor famed for playing gangsters on the silver screen
every time she went to see brando from then on she added he was wearing a different gangsterstyle moustache
brando was asked to screen test for the role in the godfather as studio executives were said to be reluctant for the actor to play the part following problems on the set of brandos previous film mutiny on the bounty 
in fact brandos academy award triumph revived his career
the actor was nominated for an oscar the following year for his role in bernardo bertoluccis last tango in paris
before his death brando granted gaming company electronic arts the rights to use his voice and image in a video game based on the godfather film and book and recorded voiceovers which closely resembled his role as don corleone
brandos costars from the godfather james caan and robert duvall will also reprise their roles for the video game it was confirmed on wednesday

indian film director mira nair has said she was thrilled to be given the chance to make william makepeace thackerays novel vanity fair  as the book has been a favourite through her life
the book is one of the classics of english literature  the story of scheming 19th century social climber becky sharp played in the film by reese witherspoon
nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film which she has  controversially  made in a bollywood style including two songanddance routines in the films second half
it was serendipity really  i was offered vanity fair by the studio focus features who had distributed monsoon wedding nair told bbc world services masterpiece programme
they offered me their nextbest thing not realising that vanity fair had actually been one of my favourite novels since i was 16 years old in an irish catholic boarding school in indiasince her 1988 debut feature salaam bombay  nominated for the best foreign language oscar and winner of best first feature at cannes  nair has become one of indias most famous and respected directors
she is not restricted to bollywood however  she followed salaam bombay with mississippi masala starring denzel washington and the perez family her first hollywood film
her career peaked with monsoon wedding in 2001 which won the golden lion award at venice
nairs indianstyle adaptation of vanity fair however has been attacked by critics in the us  where it only reached number eight at the box office in its opening week  who described the bollywood elements as jarring the film has a new ending with becky sharp running off for a new life in india
but nair said that her film had picked up on the way thackeray  who was born in india but moved to england as a young man  had seen the world
first when i was 16 it was becky sharp who is a completely memorable character because i recognised myself in her  i recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies who wanted to buck the system that they were in she said
but it was the sort of novel i somehow kept at the side of my bed for many years and i would dip into every now and then and suddenly get completely mesmerised again
as i got older and read it i think it was thackerays clarity  his clearsightedness about his own society the fact that he was born in india but came to england as a young man  that gave him the eyes of an outsider and yet he was an insider
that perspective was something i really lovednair also defended her decision to cast an american actress  reese witherspoon  as becky sharp despite the fact that all the rest of the cast are british or irish
i cast intuitively  in my films i cast as many nonactors as i cast actors she said
for me it is intuition  i have to fall in love with an actor
it is a visceral response
thackeray describes becky sharp as a minx
also shes described as someone whos tiny redheaded and thin
reese had that completely minxlike irresistibility about her having won the role because she seemed physically perfectly suited to the part however witherspoon then became pregnant
but nair said that though this had created the need for some filming tricks it had in fact also helped the film
it was a selffulfilling prophesy  when i first met her husband actor ryan philippe i said knock her up wont you i need some flesh on the girl she joked
im not a fan of the underfed los angeles actor at all
this was for me about becky sharp being eventually a fullblown woman through the course of the film
i love the luminosity that pregnancy brings i love the fleshiness i love the ample bosom  it gave me much more to play with nair explained how camera tricks had been used to disguise witherspoons bump in various scenes  including hiring a number of young boys in costumes to stand in front of her
she runs she gets off coal carts she jumps off horses  she does everything nair said
but theres also a certain carriage with horses that is going to wipe the screen at a certain moment because of the bump

french film a very long engagement has received 12 nominations for frances cesar film awards despite a recent ruling it was not french enough
the world war i romantic drama starring audrey tautou was recently ruled too american by a paris court as it was partially backed by warner bros
but the cesar organisers modified their rules to allow the film to compete
the film directed by jeanpierre jeunet received best actress picture and director nominations
last november a court judged the film was too american to compete in french film festivals
two associations of french producers challenged jeunets right to french government subsidies because warner bros was a backer
the ruling meant the movie  which was filmed in france and used french actors and technicians  was not eligible to compete for french prizes
but alain terzian president of cesar organisers the academie des arts et techniques du cinema said the changes in eligibility rules which allow films of french expression were made three months prior to the court decision
other films in the best film category include police drama 36 quai des orfevres arnaud desplechins kings and queen abdellatif kechiches lesquive and frances number one film at the 2004 boxoffice the chorus
best actors are daniel auteuil for 36 mathieu amalric for kings and queen gerard jugnot for the chorus philippe torreton for lequipier and benoit poelvoorde for podium

british actors in attendance include nominees clive owen imelda staunton kate winslet and director mike leigh
the aviator leads the shortlist but critics believe the night may belong to clint eastwoods million dollar baby
a recent poll of us pundits found eastwoods boxing drama had become the new favourite to win best film over the howard hughes biopic
if the 74yearold does win he will become the oldest person ever to be named best director at the ceremony
uk critics still favour the aviator for best film but believe the best director title will generate a close fought battle between eastwood and martin scorsese
scorsese has never won the best director prize despite four previous nominations for films including raging bull goodfellas and gangs of new york
eastwood has won best director once before for unforgiven in 1993
most experts predict the twicenominated jamie foxx will win best actor for his portrayal of singer ray charles while vera drake star imelda staunton looks likely to lose out in the best actress field to hilary swank in million dollar baby
the uks highest hopes remain with clive owen who has scooped both the golden globe and the bafta for his supporting role in closer

the 40yearold comic has already promised not to swear live on air during the show
chris has a sense of humour and everything he says is really said humorously cates said

oscarwinning director hayao miyazakis latest film has set a new japanese box office record with 15bn yen 143m in two days according to reports
howls moving castle is the followup to miyazakis spirited away which won best animation at last years oscars

its twoday takings represented 11 million cinema admissions screen daily said
the films distributor toho expects 40 million people to see it in total  almost one third of the countrys population  it added
the film won the golden osella for outstanding technical contribution at this years venice film festival

ticket sales at the us box office are predicted to break records this year with figures expected to reach 94 billion beating 2002s alltime high
overall figures could be dampened by the lack of a christmas hit like last years oscarwinning lord of the rings
traditionally ticket sales during the festive season account for 20 of the annual total
although admissions have actually fallen this year the predicted high is down to increasing ticket prices
according to exhibitor relations president paul dergarabedian the average cost of a cinema ticket could be as high as 625 in 2004 compared to 580 in 2002
this year some of the biggest hits such as the passion of the christ and fahrenheit 911 came from outside the major studios which are usually responsible for the key blockbusters
many of the films that did well with audiences are not necessarily the films that made a lot of money said mr dergarabedian
he added that surprise hits had come from some of the more arthouse offerings such as napoleon dynamite and critical hit sideways
sony pictures responsible for hits like spiderman 2 and the grudge are expected to top domestic market share for the second time in three years with 1 billionplus in sales for the third consecutive year
sony pictures entertainment vice chairman
jeff blake said we had a really diverse slate this year and
certainly we pulled off one of the surprises with grudge horror movie the grudge cost sony 10 million to make but brought in 110 million
its the latest in a recent trend for hollywood studios to back the upper and lower ends of the market whilst ignoring the middle
warner inc are likely to end the year in second place on market share with around 125 billion with disney at number three

its a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good
but spiderman 2 breaks that rule in two
its not fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of spidey versus doc ock and more so into the fate of poor peter parker
gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all looks stunning
a few effects look false but tobey maguire kirsten dunst and alfred molina make this compelling
the other universal rule is that dvds of superhero films will have making of features only about the effects
this disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film
then there are commentaries trailers and a blooper reel
sometimes quality comes in bulk this set contains no less than 34 john wayne films ranging from the westerns and war movies to the quiet man
now is that a christmas present or what give this to someone on 24 december and you wont see them again until early in the new year
its not truly a complete collection and leans more toward waynes earlier films theres no true grit for instance though there is hellraisers
the films look well transferred to dvd though none has extras
it was very daft but it knew it was and somehow this famous 1979 series became a cult favourite thats been long awaited on dvd
this set has the first season of buck gil gerard and wilmas erin gray tongueincheek adventures and its all as camp and gaudy as you remember
but its also a disappointment
the us dvd has this and the more pofaced second season  and you can import it for just about the same price
the bigger omission though is that there are no extras
thats particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars gerard and gray had agreed to do them

a us tv network is editing bbc films dirty war to avoid showing the front of a nude woman being scrubbed down after a fictional chemical attack
it is not worth showing nonessential nude scenes when indecency complaints are aggressively pursued by us tv watchdogs said pbs jacoba atlas

the film drew on transcripts of gestapo interrogations and scholls trial preserved in the archive of communist east germanys secret police
their discovery was the inspiration behind the film for rothemund who worked closely with surviving relatives including one of scholls sisters to ensure historical accuracy on the film
scholl and other members of the white rose resistance group first started distributing antinazi leaflets in the summer of 1942
they were arrested as they dropped leaflets at munich university calling for a day of reckoning with adolf hitlers regime
the film focuses on the six days from scholls arrest to the intense trial which saw scholl initially deny the charges and ended with a defiant appearance

merle kilgore cowriter of the country hit ring of fire has died of congestive heart failure aged 70
he started out as a singer and songwriter before going into music management looking after country star hank williams jr
he wrote ring of fire with june carter cash the future wife of johnny cash who went on to score his most popular hit with the track
kilgore had heart surgery in 2004 and was also diagnosed with lung cancer
his death has been attributed to treatment he was undergoing for the cancer
his first selfpenned top 10 hit was dear mama in 1959
one of the first songs he wrote for other artists was wolverton mountain which sold 10 million copies when recorded by claude king
he then wrote ring of fire with june carter cash which was about her unrequited love for johnny who she later married
it was first recorded by her younger sister anita carter before johnny went on to make such a success of it
june carter cash previously said it upset her husband when kilgore talked about the song without crediting her and believed he should not have been credited on it
last year kilgore turned up an awards dinner in a wheelchair expecting to honour hank williams jr but instead he was the surprise recipient of a lifetime achievement award from the international entertainment buyers association

to mark the 60th anniversary of the birth of reggae star bob marley rob partridge  marleys former head of press at island records  remembers the man behind the legend
partridge worked with marley from 1977 until the jamaican musicians death in 1981
 i joined island records in 1977 and the first week i was there i worked on his show at the rainbow theatre
it was one of the last dates he did in london the album exodus came out in 1977 and that provided five hits and confirmed his global superstar status
by 1979 he was the biggest touring attraction in the world
i remember going to see dates in milan and turin and they were enormous concerts bob was one of the most mesmeric people ive ever had the privilege to work with
he must have had an iron will to succeed
bob was a very driven individual
you realised from the start there was a manifest destiny within him that he believed in
he didnt suffer fools gladly
at the risk of stating the obvious he was an extraordinary song writer and his stage act was perhaps the greatest ive ever seen
i saw him many times i recall in 1978 he came to the uk for top of the pops and a daily mirror journalist did a halfhour interview
it was interrupted to do a rehearsal
he came back into the dressing room to resume the interview but saw a world cup match on tv
he sat down in front of the tv and after 10 minutes it was obvious he wasnt going to move
that was the end of it
the mirror had a very truncated interview
the last time i saw him was in london in 1980
i arranged for him to play four days of football indoors in fulham
bob was a good player
we are talking about jamaicanstyle football
he was an attacking midfield player
his team assembled wherever his gigs were
we played in brazil against some world cupwinning players it was always a struggle for him to connect with black america
reggae did not correspond with disco in the 70s
but bob in the 1990s became one of the great icons in america and the third world
in 1991 ten years after his death he sold more records than at any time during his life
we saw black america taking bob into their hearts for the first time bob in worldwide terms is the greatest music star there has ever been
if you went to africa he would be recognised everywhere in places john lennon or elvis wouldnt be
no disrespect to the other artists but a case can be made for him as the greatest the best and the most influential artist in popular music well 1981 was to be the year he toured africa with stevie wonder
he had only performed in zimbabwe and guinea before
of course the 1981 tour never happened but the whole of africa would have embraced him
we cant speculate but he was at the height of his powers and just 36 years old
i had no sense his career was going to go downhill bob was endlessly optimistic about the way africa would turn out
he realised that nothing was perfect but he had total belief in the power of mankind
im sure if he were alive today he would believe africa would firstly become politically free and secondly be able to defeat the aids epidemic the final tune of his final album was redemption song  one of the most incredible classics of all time
belle  sebastian have been named the best scottish band of all time after a three monthlong public poll
the group beat travis and idlewild into second and third place respectively
franz ferdinand who recently picked up five brit award nominations ended up in 15th place while the eurythmics wound up at a lowly 38
other scottish acts such as the mull historical society who also featured in the top 50 performed at a party in glasgow where the result was announced
scottishbased band snow patrol who finished 14th in the vote and have been nominated for a pair of brit awards were among the performers who covered wellknown scottish pop songs at the party on wednesday night
indie stalwarts belle  sebastian have enjoyed a chart career stretching back to 1997
they were the surprise winners of the brit award for best breakthrough act two years later
scottish bands from earlier musical eras also made it into the final list including 1970s tartan boy band the bay city rollers and goth favourites the jesus and mary chain
scottish magazine the list recently compiled a list of the top 50 scottish bands of all time but left the final decision to the public
the magazines music editor mark robertson said the idea behind the project was simple  to rediscover the very best of scottish music from the finest musical talent spanning from the age of 70s rock through to 80s pop right up to todays international stars everyone has strong opinions about this and we wanted to open it up to the public to decide he added
bbc radio scotland presenter vic galloway who has been involved in the project said it had been great fun to look back at scotlands musical heritage and take note of upandcoming scottish acts

dj norman cook  aka fatboy slim  has said that dance music is not dead but has admitted it is currently going through a fallow patch
the commercial failure of the latest albums by britains two biggest dance acts  fatboy slims palookaville and the prodigys always outnumbered never outgunned  has been coupled with the closure of many superclubs and the folding of three dance music magazines
last month the brit awards announced they would no longer be awarding a best dance act prize with the brits committee announcing that dance music is no longer where its happening in music these developments lead some to suggest that dance was finished as a popular music genre
cook acknowledged that much change in the dance world in the four years since his last album halfway between the gutter and the stars but he stressed this did not mean the dance scene was permanently over
every week when i was making the album i was reading articles about the demise of dance music  and obviously that affects you somewhat he told bbc world services the ticket programme
i personally dont believe its either dead or going to die but its going through a bit of a fallow patch
so i think consciously or subconsciously reading every week that dance music was dead i would think right scrub that track thenalthough his album sales in the uk are down  palookaville stayed in the uk top 75 for just three weeks  cook has achieved recent global success with his beach parties
and event on brighton sea front in 2002 attracted 250000 people while a later one in rio achieved a crowd of 360000
the dvd of the rio set was the biggest seller of that year
with a crowd that big if the weathers nice the atmosphere before i even go is so good that about halfway through the first record i think ive got them cook said
im always really really nervous before the big ones  they had to give me valium before rio because two hours before i was literally just pacing the floor
for some reason especially now ive got a reputation for it the atmosphere and the joie de vivre thats already going on means all i have to do is play up records he promised more such parties in more locations around the world  despite problems after the brighton event which ended in chaos with many revellers finding themselves stranded as transport ground to a halt
one man also died of a heart attack and a woman fell to her death during the free party
were having to widen our horizons from just beaches because theres landlocked countries that want to get involved cook said
were doing rio at the carnival at the maracana and sao paolo  our new gig is famous football stadiumsthe dj admitted however that his massive worldwide success had a downside with intense media interest in his personal life
in particular he said he had struggled to cope with tabloid intrusion during the temporary breakup of his marriage to radio one presenter zoe ball after she was linked with dj dan peppe
the tabloid thing has been difficult at times cook said
especially the meandzoegate  its quite scary he said that he had been determined that what had happened with ball did not affect the album
at first i was doing deliberately jolly tunes so that people wouldnt think i was depressed he explained
then i thought thats not right and he highlighted a bizarre coincidence  that one song written before they split had turned out to have a great deal more meaning than intended
i said to zoe i did this track called my masochistic baby went and left me do you mind if its on the album he recalled
she said yeah its hilarious because your masochistic baby did leave you cook also added that he had some ways of coping with the intense paparazzi pressure which accumulates at the end of the private road he lives on  where paul mccartney is a neighbour
its almost like prisoners rattling the bars with their mugs cook explained
if theres a pap at the end of the road everyone knocks on each others doors  paul comes round and we warn him because we dont know who theyre after
the new video of former westlife singer brian mcfadden has been pulled after a dublin school complained about being associated with his song irish son
st fintians high school says it is clearly identified in the video while mcfadden never went there
mcfadden makes claims that he was beaten at his own school in the songs lyrics saying it had cell blocks
the performers record label sony bmg has withdrawn the video and issued replacements to television stations
the label believed the school name was fictitious until they received the complaint
they have said the reference to the school was unintentional and coincidental
the head of christian brothers school st fintians richard fogarty said the video implied that the 24yearold pop star had attended his school and was abused there
the school has always treated its pupils with respect mr fogarty said in a statement
mcfadden makes specific references to the christian brothers in his song but did not attend st fintians
corporal punishment was outlawed in irish schools in 1982 when mcfadden was two years old
mcfadden whose debut solo album is released next week has said that every song is autobiographical and a true story
alcoholism and domestic violence are among the other topics dealt with in his songs half of which have been written with robbie williams former collaborator guy chambers
mcfadden who quit charttopping group westlife in march went to number one in september with his first solo single real to me
he enjoyed 12 charttoppers with the boy band before parting company with them

earlier in his career melcher had hits as part of duo called bruce  terry with future beach boy bruce johnston which evolved into the rip chords group
melcher also worked closely with his mother producing the doris day show and helping to run her charitable activities
in 1969 his name became linked with the charles manson murders which saw the deaths of actress sharon tate and four of her friends at a home which melcher once rented

franz ferdinand frontman alex kapranos has called for more government help for musicians while taking part in an edinburgh lectures discussion
for any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well he said
but kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with mps at the university of edinburgh event
i think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them he said
kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss scotlands role in making 21st century music
there are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they arent selfsufficient he said
but socalled commercial music would benefit from investment as well he warned musicians against being allied to a particular party however
i dont know if having tea with politicians is always a good ideakapranos and his glasgow fourpiece band have been nominated for five prizes at next weeks brit awards including best group and best album
their selftitled debut album won last years mercury music prize and spawned three top 20 singles
he told the 300strong audience at the universitys reid hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes
we say i like this
because i listen to nirvana and korn i am a troubled individual im riddled with angst because i listen to chopin and debussy i listen to kylie minogue and scissor sisters because im upbeat and i like to party i listen to wagner because i like the smell of napalm in the morning kapranos said there was a general hostility towards classical music adding there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fmhe concluded we define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity fellow speaker and classical composer james macmillan agreed we need to rediscover our ability to listen previous speakers at the edinburgh lectures series have included former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawking
kapranos described his appearance on wednesday as more daunting by a long way than their upcoming brits performance
i dont really care about the brits he said
its going to be great to go down but i have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonighti think the government should do more to help upandcoming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues
also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels
rather than expecting the government  ie
the taxpayer  to fork out why dont some of the megastars put something back in some of britains wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums concerts etc
there are far more important demands on government funds
if they can fund football why not fund musicareas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants so why not music we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music
the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash
the government has enough problems funding schools and health services
if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multibillion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that
as a scot living in england i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success so i can see no problem with it franz ferdinand travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goodsi think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising a multimillion pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state the answer is most definitely no
those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldnt be looking for government subsidies
i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship
yes the government should fund music  it brings joy to the masses
there are already thousands of statefunded musicians out there sitting around twiddling their thumbs on the new deal
getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use
as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move
i would hate to see more pop idoltype funding of music though as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about
only if the proposals make financial sense
franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales  if theyd had a government grant to get started theyd have more than paid it back by now so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out
however the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides theyre a musician
the government shouldnt fund music  it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment
i think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise
the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people
however i do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there
i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately the directors are in the business for if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldnt have to fork out a great deal
yeah why not music should be government funded particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bandsartists and stuff
pop music pretty much rules the earth so more attention should go to the other fraternitiesi agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer
there is a great deal of money generated through pop music  perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy
perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idolstyle music  that is the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers
call it a tax on music pollution if you like
though i really like franz ferdinand i have to disagree with mr kapranos
once government gets their hand into the private sector it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues
many years ago this was the case with the us nea when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting
the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privatelyfunded organizations like save the music in the us

us rap duo outkasts trio of trophies at the mtv europe awards crowns a year of huge success for the band
the latest triumph adds to the three grammys and four american mtv gongs won earlier in this year
andre 3000 and big bois album speakerboxxxthe love below has been critically acclaimed since its release and sold in large quantities around the world
the double album  which saw the pair produce one disc each  topped the charts in the us at the same time as single hey ya it took another track from the exponents of southern hiphop  the way you move  to displace it from the top spot
the georgia pairs year of critical and commercial triumph leaves them with a tough act to follow  what can be next for a musical act that has done it allg money a presenter on the bbcs urban music station 1xtra thinks a hiatus is inevitable after such a sustained period of exposure  giving the band time to think about other interests
they might be more appearances outside the band such as producing for other artists while they have a number of fringe music projects
andre 3000 would like to go into acting so we might see him a film while big boi already has a dogbreeding business says the dj
but in a couple of years they will be back with another album which will be a collaboration unlike their double cd
their greatness has become clear with speakerboxxxthe love below
we havent seen the last of them he adds
outkasts musical career spans 10 years and they have enjoyed commercial and critical success in the past with their debut southernplayalisticadillacmuzik going platinum
but it took until 2001 for the pair to score their first hit in the uk with ms jackson while their album stakonia saw their fame spread beyond the us
1xtras g money says it took the latest album released in 2003 for him to be assured of their genius
they have always been experimental some of it has worked and some hasnt he adds
but g money acknowledges that making the next move for a band that has reached a pinnacle can be tough
what can you do next when youve done it all he says

us rappers beastie boys have won their longrunning battle over the use of a sample in their song pass the mic
the punkrappers used three notes of music from flautist james newtons choir in their track from 1992
although the group had paid a licence fee for the sample mr newton said his copyright had been infringed
but the us court of appeal upheld its original decision that the group did not have to pay an additional fee to license the underlying composition

sampling now a standard practice among musicians involves taking a segment of one track and using it in a different song

that finding upheld a lowercourt dismissal of the case in favour of the beastie boys
we hold that beastie boys use of a brief segment of that composition consisting of three notes separated by a halfstep over a background c note is not sufficient to sustain a claim for infringement of newtons copyright chief judge mary schroeder wrote in her opinion
mr newton is a critically acclaimed jazz and classical flutist composer performer and university professor
mr newton and the beastie boys were not available for comment

but mr campbell said he learned that morrison planned to release the album through jet star which is advertising it on its website
mr campbell said im glad we were granted the injunction but im completely gutted that we have had to go that far
mark morrison was given everything he asked for by 2 wikid but it seems that he couldnt help but return to his old ways

i have always dreamt of starting a record label but now mark morrison has spoilt that dream for me
there is no loyalty in this business  just greedbut morrison is determined the album will be released on monday

the comic and actor said he had drawn up an alist of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it
we wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct gervais told bbc news
its not about the zeitgeist
we wanted people who would still be around in 20 years not just the winner of big brother to take part gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line
but he has met with stiller and jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to it
i didnt want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who havent even been asked
i have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as im going to be in a remake of 10 taking dudley moores part
i havent been approached and i wouldnt take it anywayhe said stiller and jackson would be playing twisted versions of themselves in extras and that the jokes about them would sail pretty close to the bone

meanwhile gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book flanimals which is released in the us in march around the same time as nbc begin showing the us version of the office
the film rights to flanimals have already been snapped up but gervais is keen for the project to be taken slowly
a film will happen over the next three years but i dont want it to be a 50m movie straight away because it is not well enough known and it wouldnt be another spiderman or batman
i would like to do something small on tv with it first
mtv has been criticised for incessant sleaze by television indecency campaigners in the us
the parents television council ptc which monitors violence and sex on tv said the cable music channel offered the cheapest form of programming
the group is at the forefront of a vociferous campaign to clean up american television
but a spokeswoman for mtv said it was unfair and inaccurate to single out mtv for criticism
the ptc monitored mtvs output for 171 hours from 20 march to 27 march 2004 during the channels spring break coverage
in its report  mtv smut peddlers targeting kids with sex drugs and alcohol  the ptc said it witnessed 3056 flashes of nudity or sexual situations and 2881 verbal references to sex
brent bozell ptc president and conservative activist said mtv is blatantly selling raunchy sex to kids
compared to broadcast television programmes aimed at adults mtvs programming contains substantially more sex foul language and violence  and mtvs shows are aimed at children as young as 12
theres no question that tv influences the attitudes and perceptions of young viewers and mtv is deliberately marketing its raunch to millions of innocent childrenthe watchdog decided to look at mtvs programmes after janet jacksons infamous wardrobe malfunction at last years super bowl
the breastbaring incident generated 500000 complaints and cbs  which is owned by the same parent company as mtv  was quick to apologise
mtv spokeswoman jeannie kedas said the network follows the same standards as broadcasters and reflects the culture and what its viewers are interested in
its unfair and inaccurate to paint mtv with that brush of irresponsibility she said
we think its underestimating young peoples intellect and level of sophistication ms kedas also highlighted the fact mtv won an award in 2004 for the fight for your rights series that focused on issues such as sexual health and tolerance

actor robert blake had gunshot residue on his hands and clothes the night his wife was shot dead a court has heard
but it may not have come from the shot that killed bonny lee bakley in 2001 mr blakes murder trial was told by criminalist steven dowell
mr dowell told a los angeles court the residue may have come from mr blakes revolver his gun collection his presence at the crime scene or police
the 71yearold former star of us tv drama baretta has denied murder
mr blake said he found ms bakley 44 dead in a car after they left a restaurant
he said he briefly returned to the restaurant to collect a gun he had left behind and discovered her body when he returned
the gun he collected was not the murder weapon
it could also have been picked up if he touched or leant on the car when he found the body or from a police box in which his clothes were later stored
the box had come from an area where officers went after being on the firing range
but mr dowell also said the residue would have been present if mr blake fired a gun that night
witnesses have already told the trial mr blake stood out as being quite nervous and agitated at the restaurant before the murder
the actor who won an emmy for playing a maverick detective in the 1970s tv cop drama baretta could face life in prison if convicted

us politicians are proposing a tough new law aimed at cracking down on indecency and bad language on us tv
fines of up to 500000 £266582 could be imposed each time broadcasters transmit nudity or profanities

the exposure of janet jacksons breast at last years superbowl landed cbs with a 550000 £293264 fine
entertainers could also be liable for fines under the proposed legisation from both us politcians and officials from the federal communications commission fcc
a republican senator from kansas sam brownbeck is set to call for a maximum 3 million £16 million fine for repeated violations
the current maximum fine stands at 32500 £17320  20 of the stations in the cbs network were each penalised these lesser amounts for the jackson incident
republican politician fred upton who chairs the committee responsible for broadcasting said current fines are more of a cost of doing business rather than a deterrent
last years janet jackson wardrobe malfunction encouraged the fcc to impose tougher rules but the us congress adjourned last year without agreeing on a new level of fines
new figures have to be decided before new legislation can be put before president bush
certain broadcasters like fox claim the material they carry does not violate indecency laws and is protected under the right to free speech

racing pundit john mccririck has become the latest contestant to be evicted from celebrity big brother

at one time bez was among the most popular contestants but he has since become withdrawn and argumentative

sylvester stallones exwife brigitte nielsen nominated both john and bez
she said bez is a difficult human being
theres something wrong with him

broadcaster chris evans has begun selling thousands of his possessions from a stall in camden market london
evans perched on a stool as shoppers wandered around the openfronted shop packed with his furniture
among the items from his homes in los angeles and london were countless sofas chairs pictures beds and memorabilia from his past tv shows
asked the reason for the sale evans said i just want to get rid of it all its just a headache he added it feels good to be selling this stuff its a weight off my mind
look at it all theres so much clutter
ive enjoyed every bit of furniture and every poster but its not important anymore the normally gregarious evans cut a peculiarly unshowbusinesslike figure as he sipped coffee and smoked cigarettes wrapped in a big coat and scarf in front of his aladdins cave
however the ostentation of some of the items on sale painted a picture of the eccentricity that endeared him to the british public in shows such as channel 4s gameshow dont forget your toothbrush
the most striking thing about many of the pieces was their sheer size
sofas looked like they could seat a small party and a bed seemed big enough for four
the elaborate nature of the pieces many custommade had to be admired particularly a huge red and gold upholstered throne and a stripy deckchair from the queen mary liner
to help people in their browsing evans had given the pieces labels with not only the price but a helpful often comic aside
isnt it great was the comment on the £1950 throne and bob dylans old sofa  honest was written on a dark wood couch priced £4250
the prices were steep by a lot of peoples standards but evans said it was not deterring shoppers
ive sold quite a lot already
everything here is on sale for less than i bought it for but its not really about the money
its about getting rid of it all
weve all been bartering thats what its all about he added that he was not going to reveal what he was going to do with the money he was making
vintage tv and film posters also lined the walls including a rare portrait of raquel welch and an original advertising print from the benny hill show
and almost hidden at the back of the lockup were the two giant toothbrushes from his former channel 4 show although these were not for sale
despite the sheer curiosity value of the sale there was a healthy trickle of interest from the public rather than the perhaps expected crowds
some wandered in just to browse as they would any of the other stalls not knowing that it belonged to evans
paul burgess said i didnt realise
i thought it was just a load of junk
i should go back and have a better look but local resident francesca detakats came specially to the stall and left happy with her purchase of an original 1960s photograph of the who by david wedgburg
ms detakats said she was a collector and did not mind paying £350 for the print
if you like something you dont really count it like that she said
martin hellewell who had also made a point of visiting evans shop said he thought it was a great idea
why not if youve got stuff to get rid of its a good place to do it said mr hellewell
evans has taken out the stall with business partner pete winterbottom
they plan to open every day if possible although evans did not know how often he would be there
well stay definitely until christmas and then maybe a week after that said evans

the bbcs flagship pop music programme top of the pops is to move from bbc one on fridays to sundays on bbc two
the new programme will combine with archive show totp2 mixing new music with footage of classic bands
the corporation said the new show aims to appeal to a diverse audience of music lovers
the move is the biggest shakeup in the history of the show which was first broadcast in 1964 and has always been on bbc one
top of the pops was relaunched in a blaze of publicity in december last year in an attempt to reverse a longterm decline in audience figures
the all new top of the pops was fronted by newcomer tim kash and was put together by producer andi peters who was brought back to the bbc from channel 4 to revitalise the series
about three million people a week were watching the show on fridays  less than half the total it was attracting in the mid1990s  as the programme went up against popular itv soap coronation street
but despite the relaunch audience figures failed to rise and still remain around the three million mark

the programme will have a close relationship with the bbc radio 1 chart show which suggests the relaunched show may be transmitted at about 1900 on sundays
hopefully the audience for top of the pops will find it on bbc two
we think that the new slot will create a buzz around the programme as for the first time viewers will discover the news of who is number one as it happens

people have unrealistic expectations of forensic science thanks to the success of the csi tv shows real experts say
evidence submitted to forensic labs has shot up as a result of the programmes at a time when many have large backlogs science investigators claim
lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have a distorted view of how forensic evidence is used
the issue was discussed at a major science conference in washington dc
crime scene investigation csi and its spinoffs csi miami and csi new york have proven exceptionally popular with audiences on both sides of the atlantic
each episode a team of forensic investigators goes about solving a crime through the ingenious appliance of science  and the extensive resources at their disposal
the csi effect is basically the perception of the nearinfallibility of forensic science in response to the tv show said max houck who runs a forensic science graduate course at west virginia university us
this tv show comes on and everyone starts watching it  including the cops and prosecutors  and submissions to forensic laboratories go through the roof he told the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science aaas
the american forensics expert said there were roughly 200000300000 backlogged dna samples in us labs
yet these constituted just 10 of the total test backlog said dr houck
forensic pathologist dr patricia mcfeeley said she had started to see the shows influence in dealing with the families of victims
what i find is that families now are more dissatisfied with the investigation than was previously the case she explained
for example on television the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously
but when people find out that it can take several months they can find that very difficultdr mcfeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most peoples perceptions
the shows influence can follow forensic investigators all the way into the courtroom making lawyers jittery
prosecutors fear the csi effect with juries because for example they wonder why wasnt everything tested well in fact not everything needs to be tested dr houck explained
defence attorneys also worry about the csi effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut this objective method thats always accurate however he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field
my university course started with four graduates in 1999 were now the largest major on campus  with 400 students he said
dr houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level theres more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research
minority ethnic led mel production companies face barriers in succeeding in the film and television industries research has suggested
the study commissioned by pact and the uk film council included interviews with industry experts and individuals
they indicated that career progression and a lack of role models are among the main problems within such companies
the research indicated that about 10 of independent production companies in the uk are minority ethnic led
a minority ethnic led company is defined as one in which the majority of decisionmaking power rests with an individual or individuals from a minority ethnic group
the report also explored the problems faced by such companies when attempting to compete within the film and tv industries
it said they are often smaller than other companies and lack the resources so are often squeezed out of the market by bigger firms
the research recommended that minority ethnic led companies could benefit from such positive actions as career training and business advice plus improved communication within the film and tv sectors
the uk has a rich and diverse culture and it is essential that it is reflected on film and television said arts minister estelle morris of the findings
i welcome this report which i hope will lead to more doors being opened and all businesses in our film and television industries being given the same opportunities

the permanent replacement for late dj john peels bbc radio 1 show goes on air on tuesday with three hosts chosen to fill the legendary presenters slot
rock dj huw stephens will go on air in the 2300 slot every tuesday with black music champion ras kwame on wednesdays and dance dj rob da bank on thursdays
rob da bank filled in after peel had a heart attack aged 65 in october
all three will play diverse unpredictable and noncommercial songs under the banner of the onemusic show
radio 1 said the station was not trying to replace peel but would rise to the challenge of keeping his legacy alive with unpredictable music
the three djs were chosen for their indepth musical knowledge across a variety of musical genres the station said
rob da bank is one of the hosts of the blue room an early morning weekend show which plays electronic and dance music
huw stephens has been one half of the thursday night show bethan and huw in wales which explores new music especially upandcoming acts in wales
and ras kwame is host of 100 homegrown on radio 1s digital station 1xtra dedicated to showcasing the best hiphop and garage
another change to the station lineup will see sara cox return after maternity leave
she will host the lunchtime show on saturdays from this week
good luck to all three of them not one dj could fill peels boots so its probably a good idea to get them all contributing
this time next year i hope we are saying how well these djs have done but i fear this time next year we will really realise how much john peel will be forever missed
very good idea to continue the legacy without attempting to replace john peel
also there will surely be a wider spectrum for international music as three top radio djs unite under the one world name
congratulationsthe whole glory of john peel was the fact he was not commited to one genre
he played what he liked across the range of music
this is not going to be the same and all they seem to be doing is what they already have
bring back steve lamacq
the obvious heir to john peel is the marvellous wonderful and talented claire kember from totallyradiocom
this lady is young and fresh and is one of the most knowledgeable and likeable people in british broadcasting today
everyone who listens to her show understands and compares her to the ledgendary john peel
bbc radio should seek out the real talent from internet radio stations people who are making a real impact on the world of music and the world in general

mps have urged the bbc to give watchdogs more freedom to scrutinise how £2bn in licence fee money is spent
the public accounts committee called for the national audit office to be given a free hand to investigate how the bbc offers value for money
although six areas are to be opened up to scrutiny the audit office should have more power to choose what it investigated the mps said
the call was made in a report into the bbcs freeview digital service
our aim is not to rewrite the storyline of eastenders but simply to ensure that the bbc is as accountable to parliament as any other organisation spending public money said the committee chairman mp edward leigh
the bbcs spending is not subject to the full independent scrutiny and accountability to parliament
parliament requires television owners to pay a licence fee and expects the comptroller and auditor general on behalf of parliament to be able to scrutinise how that money over £2 billion a year is useda bbc spokeswoman said we share the committees interest in ensuring the public money we receive is spent well
though in its infancy we think the arrangements with the nao are working well and should be given time to mature the report said the freeview digital service has had an impressive take up since its launch but the bbc must still dispel confusion about the service
the committee found the bbc had succeeded in ensuring subscriptionfree access to digital channels following the collapse of itv digital in 2002
but the fact that one in four homes could not access freeview remained a problem
the report said that while gaps in the coverage were largely due to landscape issues there was need for detailed explanations on the freeview website and on promotional literature as to why it was not available in specific areas
the government has proposed switch off of the analogue television signal with 2012 the most recently proposed date
the bbc launched freeview in 2002 as an alternative to satellite subscription services such as sky to allow its digital channels such as bbc three and news 24 to be seen
there have been an estimated five million freeview settop boxes sold since the launch and prices have fallen considerably
the corporation plans to spend up to £138m on freeview before 2014 to ensure people can receive the service throughout the uk and are aware of it

germaine greer has criticised celebrity big brothers bullying of housemates after quitting the reality tv show
she said superior bullying tactics like making housemates cold and hungry could encourage playground bullying
she also condemned the complete irresponsibility of adding brigitte nielsens former motherinlaw jackie stallone to the house on monday
nielsen had panicked that if she reacted badly it could harm her access to her children greer said
the feminist writer and broadcaster said big brother had behaved like a child rather than a parent by taunting contestant john mccririck after denying him a cola drink
i thought it was actually demonstrating the role of taunting in the playground and there are so many children whose lives have actually been destroyed by taunting in the playground greer said
she also said that her fellow housemates had publicityseeking agendas
i had no idea who would be in here and its wrong for me to present myself in the same context as they are media observers had been surprised by greers initial decision to join the third celebrity version of the channel 4 reality tv show given that she has written critical articles about the format in the past
as she packed her suitcase to leave the house she told fellow housemates im leaving over specific issues but best for everyone if i dont discuss them
i have a problem with decisions i make them fast and when i make them i stick to them greer had earlier failed to persuade other contestants to stage a naked protest against big brother
other celebrities to walk out of a reality show tv include sex pistol john lydon former eastenders actress danniella westbrook and exe17 singer brian harvey who all left im a celebrity
get me out of here
previous big brother housemates to leave before their time were sunita sharma and sandy cumming from the third series of the noncelebrity version of the show
vote   was germaine greer right to leave celebrity big brother   yes  no   results are indicative and may not reflect public opinionhappy mondays dancer bez is now 21 favourite to win the show followed by blazin squad singer kenzie at 52 and actor jeremy edwards at 41
ladbrokes spokesman warren lush said that the series was still wide open adding that the last 24 hours had also seen a rush of bets on mccririck slashing his odds to 81
dj lisa ianson is the outsider with odds of 401 while jackie stallone who joined the house on monday is also one of the less popular housemates at 201
the first eviction of the series has now been postponed after greers exit unexpectedly reduced the number of competitors
the eight remaining contestants are competing for a £50000 prize to be donated to the charity of their choice if they survive a series of public votes
for every 50p vote cast by viewers by telephone or text during the programmes run 9p will go to a tsunami charity appeal

us comedian bill cosby will not face charges stemming from an allegation of sexual misconduct
authorities in philadelphia said they found insufficient evidence to support the womans allegations regarding an alleged incident in january 2004
the woman reported the allegations to canadian authorities last month
cosbys lawyer walter m phillips jr said the comedian was pleased with the decision
he looks forward to moving on with his life he said
district attorney bruce l castor jr who was in charge of the case said that detectives could find no instance where anyone complained to law enforcement of conduct which would constitute a criminal offence
he also said that the fact the woman waited a year before coming forward and she had had further contact with cosby during that time were also factors in his decision
the unidentified womans lawyer dolores m troiani said her client was likely to sue the comedian
i think thats the only avenue open to her
she felt as we did that its a very strong case and she was telling the truth she also said that the woman supplied further evidence to prosecutors that she believed strengthened her allegations
cosby emerged as one of the first black comics to have mainstream success in the us
he was a successful standup before hosting the childrens show fat albert and the cosby kids and starring in the cosby show one of the biggest sitcoms of the 1980s

the british producers of us wife swap are taking legal action against a show they claim is a blatant and wholescale copycat of their programme

a spokesman for fox said it had not seen the details of the legal action and could not comment
their show was first screened in june and was criticised in the press for its similarities to wife swap
abc originally planned to call their programme trading moms but changed it to avoid confusion with the fox version

austin aitken is taking action against nbc over its programme fear factor
he said watching the show caused his blood pressure to rise so high that he became dizzy and lightheaded

a british muslim group has criticised the new series of us drama 24 which is about to be aired on sky one claiming it portrays islam unfairly
the muslim council of britain has complained to broadcasting watchdog ofcom
it says the programme breaches editorial guidelines
the groups members met with sky executives on tuesday after viewing previews of the first five episodes
the drama now in its fourth series begins on sunday evening
the new series portrays a muslim family as a sleeper terrorist cell
the muslim council of britain said in a statement we are greatly concerned by the unremittingly hostile and unbalanced portrayal of muslims in this series of 24 based upon a preview of the first five episodes that we have seen there is not a single positive muslim character in the storyline to date
at a time when negative stereotypes of muslims are on the increase we feel that sky  as a major uk broadcaster  has a responsibility to challenge these insidious views not help to reinforce them but sky denied the programme breached broadcasting guidelines
a spokesperson said during a useful meeting yesterday sky listened to the concerns raised by representatives of the council
sky does not believe that the episodes that it has reviewed to date breach ofcoms programme code fox tv which shows the series in the us is broadcasting public service announcements showing muslims in a positive light after complaints about the series

angolan families who are attempting to track each other down after being separated by nearly 30 years of war are succeeding thanks to a hugely popular tv show
meeting point has become one of tv angolas most watched programmes and has reunited hundreds of families
it runs daily not only on the television but also on the radio
every friday hundreds of people gather in luandas independence square to record a message in front of the tv cameras in the hope that a lost relative will see it
many relatives have been reunited on air
at the beginning there was an absolute explosion  huge huge crowds sergio gera the programmes chief coordinator told bbc world services assignment programme
now things are a little calmer there are slightly less people  but after two and a half years of broadcasting there are still a lot of people goingthe media in the southern african country twice the size of france has been gripped by the quest of so many people to find their relatives
hundreds of thousands of people died in angolas 30year civil war which finally ended in 2002 and tens of thousands of people are still missing
many have not heard anything for 10 or more years  in all 90 of angolan families have lost someone
the idea of recording in independence square was modelled on a square in the argentine capital buenos aries where mothers go to talk about the dead and the missing and to exchange news
one woman victoria lapete found her sister  the only remaining member of her family  in independence square live on meeting point
she had not seen her sibling for 28 years
when we saw each other we threw ourselves into each others arms she told assignment
we started to cry
i felt very very happy because id spent so long without any family
suddenly i had a sister again however angola is one of the poorest countries in africa and the number of people with access to either a television or radio is comparatively few
this means that elsewhere in the country the task of reuniting families lies primarily with the international committee of the red cross icrc
in the city of wambo the icrc runs the gazetta  a 200page tabloidsize book which contains 13000 names of missing or displaced
their task is made much harder by the huge number of landmines dotted around the country
its very difficult  there are many displaced stated joaquim sahundi head of tracing in wambo
as they try to go back home others are trying to relocate their relatives
many people are getting injured because of that  in the villages in the bush there has been no clearance of mines
when people are crossing these areas they step on mines the icrc also uses the media where it can running four daily broadcasts of their lists of the missing on radio angola
meanwhile there remain massive challenges to angolan families even once they are reunited
the programme of family reunification is extremely important but for these families to remain reunified there has to be social integration job access education healthcare said rafael marques of the prodemocracy george soros foundation for southern africa
essentially the government is waiting for the international community to pay for the reconstruction  thats why it has been persistently calling for a donors conference
that is just a way of detaching itself from its political responsibilities

a bookmaker has stopped taking bets on celebrity big brother after claiming sensitive information about the channel 4 show had been leaked
william hill made the move after four people tried to place bets on fridays surprise double eviction
this is highly unlikely to have been an inspired guess william hill spokesman rupert adams said
however a big brother spokeswoman was satisfied that sensitive information about the show remained confidential
the bookmaker said its suspicions had been aroused by betting for the last two contestant evictions when people were still trying to place large sums despite odds as short as 114
but william hills overwhelming evidence came on friday when four unknown callers asked to place bets on the shows surprise double eviction
shortly afterwards model caprice and actor jeremy edwards left the show
mr adams believed someone had gained access to figures which revealed how viewers were voting and was using them to predict which celebrity would be evicted next
we think somebody somewhere has got them and has been trying very hard to take us to the cleaners he said
the bets were not taken
mr adams did not believe anyone from channel 4 or big brother producer endemol had tried to place the queried bets
but he added they need to look at how many people are privy to the sensitive informationbig brothers spokeswoman said only a handful of senior production executives are privy to any sensitive information regarding eviction voting and there are strict procedures in place to keep this information strictly confidential
we do not feel the need to investigate this further as we are satisfied that these measures are effective the shows independent adjudicator  the electoral reform services  was also satisfied she added
the current series of celebrity big brother ends on sunday with happy mondays star bez actress brigitte nielsen and blazin squad rapper kenzie competing for a £50000 charity prize
bookmaker ladbrokes said it would continue to accept bets on the final with kenzie its favourite at 29
we felt no need whatsoever to close the book spokesman warren lush said
weve seen absolutely no suspicious betting patterns mr lush added that people sometimes vote on short odds because they think its like buying money
you do have to risk quite a lot of money for a very small gain but if they think theres no chance of an upset they will still do it he said

the head of us tv network fox has admitted the broadcaster had relied too heavily on reality tv shows such as the poorrating whos your daddy
chief executive gail berman said in the case of this fall we drifted to too much on the unscripted side
the series whos your daddy where a young woman tries to pick her natural father for a cash prize caused outrage from adoption groups and rated badly
last season foxs primetime audience fell by 600000 to 59 million
ms berman said i think the audience expects loud things from fox
sometimes they work and sometimes they dontwhos your daddy the first episode of which was shown on 3 january pulled in a disappointing audience of 63 million according to the nielsen ratings system
five other episodes of the show had also been filmed will be dropped from foxs schedules ms berman said
she was predicting a drop in ratings even for some of the networks established reality shows such as american idol which is due to start its fourth series this week
fox had unveiled a new strategy last year promising to launch new shows every season including the traditionally quiet summer season
though that had met with a poor reception ms berman said theres no question that the audience in our mind is ready willing and able to accept new programming in the summer
fox has changed this plan launching new shows in may instead of june
one of the new shows will be the animated series american dad made by seth macfarlane the creator of family guy
that series after becoming a hit on dvd is also set to return with new episodes

singer alex kapranos was studying english at university but had friends at art school and the lineup was completed when guitarist nick mccarthy moved from munich germany to the city
at the turn of the year kapranos told bbc news online the band were fed up with serious bands in that postrock thing that seemed to be doing its damndest to avoid any bloody tune
we want people to go away from the gigs humming the tunes that we were singing
but at the same time bringing an edge to it franz ferdinand had a question they asked themselves every time they wrote a song kapranos said
wheres the fun in that they pondered at every stage making enjoyment the top priority and ensuring they did not disappear up their own muso posteriors
the band started out with a diy ethic that saw them take over a disused artdeco warehouse in glasgow and rename it the chateau
the venue soon became legendary  so wellknown that the police spent a month trying to find it eventually raiding it and arresting kapranos

charlie simpson took his new band fightstar to the stage on friday night just hours after officially announcing his departure from pop band busted
he was greeted by a sellout crowd at the university of warwick
confirmation of busteds longrumoured split had come earlier in the day when simpson held a press conference in london with bandmates matt willis and james bourne
all three band members stressed that the break up was amicable although bourne admitted he was devastated to hear of simpsons departure
this has been a really difficult decision 19yearold simpson revealed i hope the fans will understandwhile simpson declared he would look back with pride on busteds enormous success his focus turned immediately to fightstar with fridays press conference coinciding with the start of the bands 13date tour of the uk
fuelled by this news all 1400 tickets to see charlies first postbusted live appearance  at the university of warwicks student union  sold out rapidly
mike eccleshall the venues promotions coordinator said tickets had been selling strongly over the past few days but sales went mad after the news broke
we had completely sold out by 4pmwith queues outside the venue long and expectations high the pressure was on fightstar to impress
although many dedicated fans travelled to the gig from around the country they faced a tough crowd made up chiefly of students the average age of the audience far exceeding that of any busted concert
gone were the screaming girls to which simpson had become accustomed
support act brigade fronted by simpsons brother played a short set first and were met with general approval
when fightstar eventually took to the stage around 11pm however a riotous cheer easily drowned out any hecklers lurking in the crowd
unfortunately the band were initially hindered by technical teething problems as simpsons guitar amplifier failed to work
as sound technicians rushed to fix it other band members did their best to improvise
when they eventually got under way fightstars blend of emotionally charged rock was warmly received
far heavier and less commercial than busteds charttopping poppunk the band will undoubtedly appeal to a more mature fanbase
warwick student helen clutterbuck admitted i came to check out fightstar because of all the controversy
ive never heard them before but im pretty impressed less impressed were fellow students ryan crabbe and gordon rennie who observed with fightstar charlie has clearly progressed from busteds sound but theyre still not very inspiring fightstar played for around 45 minutes showcasing material from their forthcoming ep called they liked you better when you were dead due for release in february

by the time the band released their third album the holy bible in october 1994 edwards had been admitted to hospital with depression

tony wilson the music mogul who established the influential factory records in the 1980s is to launch a new label  convinced he has discovered his third major band
factory were the label of both joy division  who became new order after singer ian curtis committed suicide  and the happy mondays
now wilson believes rap act raw t  signed to his f4 label the fourth incarnation of factory  will complete the hattrick
suddenly when raw t came into my life i realised they are my third major band he told bbc world services the music biz programme
the group are set to release their first single on 21 february and follow it up with an album realise and witness in march
wilson has twice tried to resurrect factory  which lasted for 14 years before folding  but conceded these efforts had been despondent and dismal experiences
but it has not put him off
of all the things i do in my life the most exciting thing ive ever done and the thing i have most loved is being part of a record company he added
the idea of working with brilliant young musicians and being close to the centre of popular culture is just the biggest thrill in my life wilson explained how his son persuaded him to go and see raw t but he had initially been reluctant saying he detested young british people rapping
its always inauthentic its always crass it never really works for me he said
i went to see this group raw t  which stands for realise and witness talent  and like everyone else in the room that night we were utterly blown away wilson believes raw t could be to f4 as joy division were to factory records
the story of factory records  which also owned the legendary hacienda club in manchester  was told in the michael winterbottom film 24 hour party people in which wilson was played by steve coogan
wilson stressed that the independent music scene remained as important as it had been during the 1980s when labels such as factory and rough trade proliferated
he pointed out that franz ferdinand and the white stripes  perhaps the two most important bands since the millennium  were signed to indies
i think that is a reflection of how useful and how powerful the indie philosophy is and how bands prefer it he added
they can make more money that way  its a more generous relationship and also its a more understanding relationship
i think independents are in a wonderful position at this moment in time

the pop star cancelled her onyx hotel tour last june after suffering a knee injury during a video shoot
she is now seeking to be reimbursed for the tours £5m 93m costs in a claim filed at new york state supreme court

the reggae industry is to refuse to release or stage concerts featuring homophobic songs under a global deal struck with gay rights groups
a damaging campaign against stars such as beenie man and sizzla has been waged over lyrics that allegedly call for gay people to be killed or assaulted
the campaign which led to gigs being scrapped and a uk police investigation will now be dropped under the truce
brett lock of gay group outrage said they were wiping the slate clean
the protests had been led by the stop murder music coalition an umbrella group including outrage the black gay mens advisory group and jamaican movement jflag
that coalition has reached a verbal agreement with major dancehall reggae record labels and concert promoters covering eight of the scenes biggest stars
but the artists themselves were not involved in the negotiations and have not directly signed up
instead the record companies have pledged not to release or rerelease any offensive songs  many of which date back a number of years
and it is believed promoters will make stars agree not to perform such tunes on stage
the reggae industry will work with the artists while still maintaining their freedom of speech and artistic freedom according to media and pr strategist glen yearwood who is representing the reggae industry
the industry would halt any attempt by an artist to perform or release a song inciting violence against any group or gender he said
well advise them this is not the way forward in a civilised society the stop murder music campaign saw protesters picket gigs resulted in sizzlas uk tour being cancelled in november forced mobo award organisers to drop artists from nominations and saw beenie man dropped from an mtv show in august
police have also been investigating whether lyrics incite the assault and murder of gay people
the campaign was a blow to the reggae industry mr yearwood admitted
if you cant have major stars touring then you dont sell many albums he said
but the artists  beenie man sizzla elephant man buju banton bounty killer tok capleton and vybz kartel  will not have to apologise for past songs or comments
outrages mr lock said the main players in the dancehall reggae industry will attempt to regulate the industry themselves to ensure that there arent any violently homophobic or gaybashing lyrics in the future
as a gesture of good faith the stop murder music coalition has agreed to suspend our aggressive campaigning against murder music
so we shall not be picketing concerts or calling for prosecutions to give the industry the space to regulate and reform itself record companies vp and greensleeves distributor jet star and concert promoters including jammins and apollo entertainment are all on board

im speechless
best song of the last 25 years yeah right
i very much doubt that angels was even the best song of the week that it came out
like every track robbie has released as a single its a blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better before
give us a breakbest song in 25 years you must be joking
its good if you like that sort of thing but reallylistened to angels on radio 1 this morning when i was driving into work
had not heard it for a while
i love robs voice the lyrics and tune
perfectionas usual the public have short memories when it comes to voting for the greatest
there must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more
its not exactly groundbreaking
presumably the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low
im actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 yearswhat about the specials  ghost town the buzzcocks  ever fallen in love with someone
happy mondays  kinky afro mcalmont  butler  yes joy division  love will tear us apart
angels is middleoftheroad rubbish
angels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap
its musically and lyrically inept and fantastically overrated a bit like mr williams himself
this result isnt very surprising though the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish musicbest of the last 25 years maybe
cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really
not much competition in the last 25 years after all
its alright for a pop song  but the best song of the last 25 yearsthere is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 yearsits a travesty
rubbish who voted it for it to be included in any list i am a regular listener to radio 2 but i dont recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldnt know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last 25 years
how depressing and just when we thought manufactured pop was on the way out  where on earth did this dreadful list appear fromwhile i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won in all seriousness i think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty
then again well done robbie good show
youve got to be kidding
angels is a great song but not the best song of the last 25 years
only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits
i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i dont think its the best song from the past 25 years right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what was will young doing being nominated in the first place  he is alright but the song isnt that good im happy for robbie himself thoughbest song in the last 25 years what a joke think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels
phil collins doesnt deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote angels is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it
soppy rubbish at best
hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards
so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me its proof that music and democracy just dont mix
still at least it wasnt will young
oh its all just a bit of fun
people take these awards too seriously robbie has millions of loyal fans while even nonfans know the words to angels
him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards
personally i wanted will young to win but that was not really due to his musical talenti hate the song all it brings back is memories of school discos and noone to slowdance withi agree about angels
i never get fed up hearing it
whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up smile and sing along very badly that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out
the song makes me calm and serene and happy
well done robbie
i think that although robbie williams is a good performer that angels isnt really that good a song
it certainly isnt anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush
angels is a fantastic song
all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers
its a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups
robbie did in no way deserve that mantle
whenever we have these awards it is always artists from the past five years that seem to win the best of the bestwe forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example
they werent cool at the time but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think
yes angels is the best song since the past 25 years because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning
ive always disliked angels intensely
i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british preteens teens and middle aged women to accept low quality low aspirational music as classic songwriting
its orrible
it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who dont particularly like music all that much
folks without collections folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music
angels adds nothing  it is merely an irritating distraction  a wasp that refuses to go away on a summers afternoon picnic
what a dreadful result
if you voted for it  you should feel ashamed of yourself  you probably only know a dozen songs or so dont you  so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote
booo hisssangels best song you are kidding right last five years i might be willing to accept but 25 no way
did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say 1995 really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century
no surprise about robbie williams considering the list
where on earth did the nominations list come from compiled by an eleven yearold girl perhaps i mean will young come on
what a load of crap best song in the last 25 years  i dont think so what about all the real artists out there over the last 25 years  the list is endless but robbie williams doesnt even come close
what a joke
that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word angels where i thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tells me the radios off
why a halfbaked cheesy ditty like angels which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example and by whom should be voted the best song of the past 25 years is beyond me
if this is the song against which all others are judged then musicians may as well give up
why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list was very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last 25 years i think not i didnt realize radio 2 had so many listeners under the age of 10people have such short memories a great song yes but the best of the last 25 years not a chance
i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here
the great british public at work again
its a mediocre sentimental and safe song
granted its not too bad either
but can it stand up against anything by the smiths in particular how soon is now or anything from the stone roses first album nope
no because im not female and im not 10ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song
but it is no way the best song of the past 25 years the shortlist wasnt great but him winning it is a jokepredictable and laughable
the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last 25 years
the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed
whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbies repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years
i am a huge robbie fan and love that song
but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs  music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the list
have radio 2 listeners even heard of joy division a band who through two albums have had a bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last 25 years than robbie williams ever will
no doubt about it
theres not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling
some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song
it should have been joy divisionthose guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song
i sincerely do not believe that in 25 years from now the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds the beatles and nick drake have done for music today
yes i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people
there were other great songs in the category
but somebody had to win robbie was a deserved winner
i am astounded that such a secondrate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs its a terrible song voted for by the masses who dont have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music
the best song of the past 25 years really come on this is surely a joke no i think i need a long lie down
it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division
i suppose its confirmed one thing  the british public are consistently dull  ltno offence robbie but pleeease there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids
no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music and a further nail in the coffini think robbie deserves it he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide
anybody who says he doesnt deserve it is jealous of his success
the only real challenger was queen but hey another one bites the dustobviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it
if this is the best song of the last 25 years then the british music industry is in trouble
sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material but this is not the best record
a sad day for musicits not the type of music i normally like but even as a diehard rock fan i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people
thats why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years
its a good allrounder
just like robbie
best song in 25 years since 1980 im confused
angels isnt a bad song
its a nice catchy formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes
but this is not great music
if anything its regressive
bland even
i suppose its just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become
granted angels is a good song however it really wasnt up against any other proper competition
the queens song was lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices were pathetic also why werent the stones there david bowie etc there are so many greater songs than angelsi wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasnt getting more awards so they had to make one up for himbest song of the last 25 years what a ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner
sigh
on the upside at least it wasnt bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankful
angels is without doubt a great song but i really dont think it deserves the title of best song in 25 yearsperhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual song dont get me wrong im not disputing his looks but there are more deserved winners
it would have been a travesty had angels not won
without angels robbie williams may well not be where he is now and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists
it has to be seen performed live with 125000 people singing along to be fully appreciated
well done rob
i find it hard to believe that angels is the best we have to show for the past 25 years im rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning
what about britpop blur oasis suede pulp
not only making fantastic songs but also making changes doing something different
why must best always come down to most commercially popularive nothing against robbie i actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales
the same goes with the scissor sisters i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award but the album comes no where near u2s new record neither are they in the same league
once again there have been some baffling discisions made they are not for artisic reasons but for profit
no surprise really its voted for by the general public
since when did they have taste in musicpersonally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heardit absolutely deserved to win
it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come
its an absolute joke however most of the original 25 were very poor choices as well
all in all a pretty pointless exercise the song is overplayed and oversentimental
out of the rather poor five choices that were left it should have gone to either joy division or queen
i suppose we should be thankful that it didnt end up in the hands of will young though
although it has nostalgia value there is no way it deserved to win
everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody nothing compares 2 u etc
much better songs and more timeless
give it to someone with real talent
although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years
this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye
why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if thats all it means
rb star jamelia had three brit nominations to go with her triple triumph at last years mobo awards
the birminghamborn singer full name jamelia davis was signed to a record label at the age of 15 and released her first single so high at 18
she released four number ones from her 2000 album drama including the top five hit money featuring the vocals of reggae artist beenie man
she racked up five mobo nominations in 2000 winning one for best video
but in the same year she also fell pregnant and decided to take a break from music to bring up her daughter teja who was born in march 2001
while she originally planned to get back to work pretty swiftly after giving birth it was actually two years before she released another single
during her absence rb music exploded and a whole host of female artists were on the scene meaning jamelia had to once again prove herself
her comeback song bout featuring rah digga only just scrapped into the top 40
it was her next single superstar that really put her back on the map as one of britains most popular female rb singers holding her own in a music scene dominated by us artists such as beyonce and ashanti
superstar was followed by thank you winner of best single at the 2004 mobos which reached number two in the uk charts
the autobiographical song which deals with domestic abuse hit number one in new zealand and australia
next came the song see it in a boys eyes which was especially written for her by coldplays chris martin
his involvement with the song meant not only was it given massive publicity but it was also greeted favourably by a new audience who would not usually listen to rb
she now combines singing with modelling and supporting charities including the nspcc and make trade fair
despite her huge success in recent years jamelia remains downtoearth about her fame and her chances of lasting in the fickle music business partly due to motherhood
when i first got into the industry id be away from home for months at a time
but now i have other things in my life
i still want to make it but its not the end of the world if i dont commented jamelia

indie dance band kasabian built up a cult following throughout 2004 to secure three brit award nominations
the fourpiece leicester band blends dark electronics with rock earning kasabian places on the best british group rock act and live act shortlists
they have also earned a reputation as outspoken and charismatic in contrast to fellow brit nominees such as keane and snow patrol
british music needs a kick up the arse and britain needs a new band to breathe life into the british people again declared kasabians singer tom meighan
noones doing it at the minute
music feels like its in the afterlife right now
we dont want people to give up on it
the serpents going to rise from the sea and scare all the pirates away meighan grew up in leicester with kasabian songwriterguitarist sergio pizzorno and bassist chris edwards a trio which began making music from the age of 17
they enlisted guitarist and keyboard player christopher karloff after spotting him in a pub
we saw his long sideburns and thought hey he looks the part well ask him said meighan
inspired by britpop and a mutual love of hardcore an early 1990s genre that fused house music with hip hop beats and a dark sensibility they added an electronic element to the traditional guitar sound
we got a computer and we cut rocknroll up because theres no point in going back to how it was said meighan
its all about new ideas and creativitythe bands original approach is reflected in its name inspired by linda kasabian  the getaway driver of us serial killer charles manson
coincidentally it is also the armenian term for butcher
kasabian moved into a remote farmhouse in rutland to record their debut album benefiting from its isolation but also managing to sneak in a few parties while they were there
signed to the rca record label kasabian tested the water with two singles club foot and lsf which reached numbers 19 and 10 in the uk singles chart respectively
they built up their following on the summer festival circuit opening both glastonbury and t in the park and at a series of guerilla gigs at unusual venues including half time orange a pub next to leicester city football clubs headquarters
kasabians selftitled album was released last september to widespread critical acclaim its indie dance stance drawing comparisons to the stone roses primal scream and the happy mondays
regarding it as both a fiery assertion of rock n roll ethics and proof that a siege mentality is alive and well in the badlands of rutland water the nmes praise was typical of the albums reception
as 2004 progressed kasabian would score a further two hits  processed beats and cutt off  and embark upon a wellreceived uk tour
we take our music seriously definitely but we want to have fun with it said pizzorno
this is not a job to us added meighan
this is the best life we could ever have
this is what its all about and without it wed be lost souls
but music needs us as well
joss stone a 17yearold soul singer from devon beat dizzee rascal jamelia lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards
her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is
im not really comfortable with the word urban
its a word thats been manufactured in this country and america to describe black music
the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that its wrong
how far are the brits removed from innercity music and what people are doing its so far removed that i dont expect them to get it bang on
the music industry isnt championing music from our particular genre very well anyway
people dont feel like thats anything to do with us
i dont feel like urban musics just been celebrated by joss stone winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that theres an urban music scene because its all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day
its not really relevant
if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who shes signed to then so be it
its got nothing to do with whats really going on
urban as a genre is very broad
if you look underneath urban there are a number of core elements that include hiphop rb garage and into that obviously comes soul
joss stone is a soul artist
her first album was called the soul sessions
so urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of subgenres and there are offshoots of all of those
joss stone has had amazing success in the us given that shes a uk artist
what has really captured everybodys imagination is that here you have a 17yearold from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good  i think thats whats done it
the award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv base
i dont think joss was not a worthy winner
she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban
the fact that shes from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and shes literally rural
the great thing about urban music is that theres a big range
if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain i think thats where you can call it urban  thats where this new subcategory or ubercategory has come from
joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you couldnt argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions  it is coming from somewhere genuine
it has to come across as real
thats the only cutoff point we have here and thats the only way by which we judge people
what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background
music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multicultural britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion
if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too
race doesnt make a difference if everyone is included
out of all the awards dished out yesterday im still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award
a type of music especially street music that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life
she might not be urban but when did rb become the hip hop tainted thing it is now rb stands for rhythm and blues rememberthat joss stone is rubbish is certain
if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music i think probably should include hiphop soul  funk at least but not rock or pop this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stakes a good claimshe definitely deserved to win a prize joss stones albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year
this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who werent nominated or didnt win
i cant see why people cant just congratulate her for the talent that she is
she did deserve it but i agree with the comments about urban music
its a stupid phrase and particularly british
in the states they tend to use hip hop and rb if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what im talking about
very strange
whats in a name a rose by any other name etc
if people want to call it urban why not if we really analysed it the term dance music is misleading because it doesnt describe everything you can dance to
whilst i agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won
urban to me is what i hear being played in parties in the inner cities  i live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties ive been to
good luck to joss stone lets celebrate her victory  lets also question why with artists so successful and talented as jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia keys and outkast  we didnt see a single black artist on stage collecting an award
so what youre saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isnt black
and if it is then they shouldnt be acknowledged for it even if theyre pretty dam good at it shes 17 has an amazing voice and won
good on her
oh but shes not black well lets make her feel real bad about it then
how dare she though hang on didnt the socalled public vote on this onethis idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what jazz was
the media then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz much to the chagrin of the artists
it would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop cool and ragtime all very different styles at that time
jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term
and so what of urban music in truth its a lazy term to categorise music that you dont really understand
soul and garage are worlds apart musically marvin gaye v tuff jam but no doubt have their connections
if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it represents
i demand a prize for rural music sucks to the cities its way better out here
we have hay for one thing
excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely i dont understand the point that ty is making
if lemar who makes music which is less soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing
btw im black toohow can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside nonsense
i love joss to bits and dont care what her branding is  its amazing music full stop
stop puting it all in brackets and lets just call it music and lets especially drop the black  urban tag  nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour
surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is historically considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from
joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music
if that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that stylethe term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards
the very term music of black origin has confused and offended many people
this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards
it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable
the term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind
the result is now a redundant new debate as to what urban also means
perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soulrnb and hiphop one which does not also mean something else  as we have done with crunk
urban is just a word thats come about recently to describe black music thats become popular now
the word wasnt even in use or common use five of six years ago
its just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it
im in a band that has been called urban and i despise the label
id hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche because thats all it is
ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity
look at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music
ignore the labels it is what it is just music
as a black man i think i agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives
black people should lead the music they invented 
we should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless
the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black same thing with streets amy winehouse etc
whos ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson
they are both 10 times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos  but why not britsso what if joss stone won the urban awards
her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner what if the streets had won would people be whining because mike skinner is white
it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else
urban is pc version for saying black music
im not doubting ms stones talent but why didnt jamelia or lemar get a brit this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thing
refreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days
more power to you people you have said it there is music you like and music you dont like  who cares what label you put on itthat entire category was a mess
how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone its like putting eminem against bob geldof
she should have been nominated for best british r  b act
joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents but i dont think it was very urban of her to sing angels with robbie williams
urban is a nonsense term  music of black origin well doesnt that include rock music made in the inner cities well almost all bands end up making music in londonmanchester etc
and doesnt that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities it doesnt make any sense
why does music have to be put into a genre its music you like it or you dont
simple as that
i play in a heavy metal band
we are urban music as far as im concerned
we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment it therefore directly shapes what we write musically
urban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music
why it needed a rebrand i dont know as the name is misleading
oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as theyre a white rock band they wont be described as such
joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery  what other reason do they need to award her the brit all this urban and other such categorisation is just the redtape of the music business and is best ignored
yeah she deserved it
she is talented
urban is a crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though
theres only two kinds of music good and bad

proposals to open a museum dedicated to jimi hendrix are flailing because of a row over the home of his late father
the rundown house in seattle has already been moved wholesale once and local authorities are now demanding it be moved to another site
hendrix supporters hoped to turn the home into a museum for the guitarist
the mayor is going to go down as the mayor who destroyed jimi hendrixs house said ray rae marshall of the james marshall hendrix foundation
the foundation moved the building in which al hendrix lived between 1953 and 1956 when the land it was built on was to be developed for housing in 2002
now the city of seattle wants its new plot to be used for development giving a deadline of 22 february for the home to be moved
mr goldman said the authority had promised the house could remain on its new site and be turned into a memorial and community centre
seattle officials said no such deal had been offered
we never said you can own this property said john franklin chief of its operations department
from our perspective it was a temporary situation
we have not threatened to demolish the house
weve simply asked that they have to move it now mr goldman is calling for the authority to pay to move the building to seattles central district where hendrix grew up
janie hendrix the guitarists stepsister said the family were still hoping the guitarist would be honoured by having a road named after him
thats something my father really wanted to see she said
it would be nice if we didnt have to fight for everything to get it hendrix was widely considered one of the most important guitarists of his time
he died of drug overdose in 1970 at the age of 27

us hiphop star kanye west  who leads the race for this years grammys with 10 nominations  rose to prominence by producing songs for artists such as jayz and alicia keys
he then emerged from his behindthescenes role to become an artist as well as a producer
but his solo career almost ended before it began after a nearfatal car crash left west with his jaw wired shut in 2002
the resulting song through the wire became wests first uk hit in april 2004 and subsequent album the college dropout became a transatlantic success both critically and commercially
west 26 began rapping as a teenager at his chicago school inspired by the beats and rhymes of 1980s pioneers run dmc
hiphop producer no id encouraged west to sample old soul and rb hits then revive them with an updated sound an approach that would become his trademark
i feel like a lot of the soul thats in those old records that i sample is in me he said
so when i hear them and i put them with the drums and i bring them to the new millennium its just like gods doing that
im one with them records right there
its a blessingleaving his chicago art school after only one year  a move which would later inspire the title of his album  west began his music career coproducing songs for artists mase and the madd rapper
this drew the attention of superstar rapper jayz who signed west up to his rocafella record label to produce numerous artists on his roster
wests work gained mainstream recognition when he produced the singles takeover and izzo hova on jayzs own 2001 album blueprint
incorporating samples of five to one by the doors and the jackson fives i want you back respectively the hits were credited with injecting soul back into hiphop
as their success attracted further production work for jayz 03 bonnie  clyde and artists such as ludacris stand up and alicia keys you dont know my name west announced plans for a solo album
driving home from a latenight los angeles recording session in october 2002 he was involved in the car crash that left his jaw fractured in three places
anytime i hear about any accident my heart sinks in and i just thank god that im still here he later said
that steering wheel could have been two inches further out and that would have been itwests account of the accident sampled chaka khans hit through the fire to become the heart of his completed solo album the college dropout
released last year it was by turns smooth humorous and sharp and largely avoided the clich233d hiphop preoccupation with guns girls and jewellery
through the wire was quickly joined in the uk and us charts by slow jamz on which west collaborated with rapper twista and ray actor jamie foxx
the college dropout spawned two further uk hits and a string of award nominations
west was shortlisted for 10 grammys  including nominations for artist and album of the year  and took the best hiphop artist producer and album titles at last years music of black origin mobo awards
now a respected rapper and producer in the influential field of hiphop kanye west is unlikely to regret his decision to leave college early

the debut album which took the best british album title at the brits on tuesday moved up seven places from number eight to number one
also capitalising on brits success were the scissor sisters whose eponymous album moved three places to number two

u2 who have won three prestigious grammy awards for their hit vertigo are stubbornly clinging to their status as one of the biggest bands in the world
the most popular groups in the history of rock all have several things in common
the music must be inspired and appeal across generations and be distinctive if not always groundbreaking
but such success is down to more than music
they have to be compelling performers charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decisions and keep their feet on the ground
they also have to want it
they have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it
the beatles had it the rolling stones still have it rem hold onto it and queen were it in a catsuit
and u2 have it in spades and keep churning it out
their new album how to dismantle an atomic bomb comes 28 years after the schoolfriends got together in dublin and 17 years after the joshua tree cemented their place on the alltime rock alist
they may have lost some of the edginess and raw youthful force that propelled them to the top but they have lost none of the desire or ability to craft songs and albums
vertigo the first single from the new album went straight into the uk singles chart at number one knocking eminem off the top spot and giving them their 26th top 10 hit
the challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better  to make records the whole world will listen to bono recently said
drummer larry mullen jr echoed those sentiments were very competitive  we want to be on the radio have big singles
we dont want to be thought of as a veteran band the band have done everything in their considerable powers to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world according to q magazine editor paul rees
this makes them hugely determined and formidable he added they are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up
as such theyve constantly reinvented and challenged themselves
they are perhaps alone as the only rock band that has got better with age the other key ingredient was the fact they were highly organised mr rees said
they do everything in the right way the group were born when mullen put an appeal for bandmates on a high school notice board attracting fellow pupils paul hewson bono vocals adam clayton bass david evans the edge guitar and his brother dick
dick evans soon dropped out and the fourpiece were known as the feedback and the hype before settling on u2
by 1978 they had won a talent contest and got noticed by a manager paul mcguinness
they were brilliant but very coarse mcguinness recently said
in a way they were doing exactly what they do now
only badly they struggled to attract record company attention later being described as pretty damn average and strange and eerie by scouts who saw them live
they released two irelandonly singles which topped the national charts in 1979 and 1980 leading to a deal with island and their debut album boy
the stadiumfilling anthemic sound was u2s aim from the start and their third album war saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the atlantic going to number one in the uk and 12 in the us
songs like sunday bloody sunday and new years day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band  which bono rejected as a cliche
his stage performances  which included flagwaving speakerclimbing and drumthrowing  earned him a reputation as an electric performer and their appearance at 1985s live aid is widely seen as sealing their global stardom
in 1987 the joshua tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including where the streets have no name i still havent found what im looking for and with or without you
those songs took the bands epic atmospheric sound to a simple powerful and popular pinnacle
the end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band  they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements
these came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music plus wildly extravagant stage shows while still trying to retain their mass appeal
the achtung baby album in 1991 was followed by zooropa pop and their corresponding stadium tours which featured giant olives flying cars live phone calls to the white house and bonos transformation into alteregos the fly and macphisto
he was also building a parallel reputation  not always to the pleasure of his bandmates  as a campaigner on issues from global debt to aids
before the release of how to dismantle an atomic bomb they had sold 125 million albums around the world
but they still want more

ray charles who has won a string of posthumous grammy awards belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music
his sound encompassed so many styles  blues gospel jazz rock n roll even country  and had a real impact on the nascent uk beat and rb scenes
compared in stature to elvis presley by some commentators charles songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as joe cocker steve winwood eric burdon and van morrison
his influence has extended to contemporary artists such as norah jones with whom he recently recorded a duet
if james brown was the godfather of soul then ray charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers
along with sam cooke he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south baptist church with the devils music of rb to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists
without charles it is hard to imagine the tearstained atlantic rb sound of aretha franklin otis redding or wilson pickett
he was also a talented jazz composer arranger and band leader playing at the newport jazz festival and carnegie hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as milt jackson and david fathead newman
unfortunately he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era  that of heroin addiction which led to him being arrested in 1965
his string of 1950s atlantic rb successes included songs that would be covered by the firstgeneration rock n roll greats including ive got a woman roy orbison elvis presley and hallelujah i love her so eddie cochran
after the exuberance of his 1959 signature song whatd i say charles turned towards a more poporiented style recording hoagy carmichaels sentimental string ballad georgia on my mind and the upbeat hit the road jack
he also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of hank williams standards such as your cheating heart and you win again
more than 40 years after its release his 1962 abc album modern sounds in country and western music is still regarded as a classic
his version of don gibsons i cant stop loving you topped the pop and rb charts in the us
in 1972 he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album a message from the people
on it he took a stand on poverty and civil rights  echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as stevie wonder james brown curtis mayfield and marvin gaye
more than 20 years later he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album my world which featured hiphop beats  although charles claimed at the time not to know what hiphop was
among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when charles died aged 73 in june 2004 was one from his friend the producer quincy jones who described him as a brother in every sense of the word
there will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as ray charles did he said
former manfred mann singer paul jones who sang on 1960s hits such as come tomorrow and sha la la said charles was one of his heroes
im quite sure my own writing was influenced by him he told bbc news online
i would put money on the proposition that ray charles will have an influence on music forever
the memory of soul legend ray charles dominated the music worlds leading music ceremony on sunday as he was given eight posthumous grammy awards
charles who died in 2004 got honours including record and album of the year while alicia keys and actor jamie foxx performed a musical tribute to him
rb star keys won four awards herself at the grammy ceremony in los angeles
u2 usher norah jones and kanye west got three each
west led the race going into the ceremony with 10 nominations
charles last album genius loves company a collection of duets that has sold more than two million copies was named album of the year and best pop vocal album
his song here we go again with norah jones won record of the year and best pop vocal collaboration while heaven help us all with gladys knight picked up best gospel performance
jones said im glad hes getting recognised because of who he is and how much i love him actor jamie foxx  who is nominated for an oscar for playing charles in the hit movie ray  dedicated a rendition of georgia on my mind to old friends
keys looking to replicate her grammys success of 2002 when she won five picked up best rb song for you dont know my name and best rb album for the diary of alicia keys
she also shared the award for best rb vocal performance by a duo or group with usher for my boo
ushers other victories were for best contemporary rb album for confessions and best rapsung collaboration for yeah featuring lil jon and ludacris
kanye west dominated the rap categories winning best rap song for jesus walks and best rap album for the college dropout
but in one of the nights biggest shocks he lost out in the battle to be named best new artist to pop rock act maroon 5
vertigo by rock giants u2 won three trophies  best rock song best short video and best rock vocal performance by a duo or group
one of the other main awards song of the year went to us singersongwriter john mayer for daughters
mayer also won best male pop vocal performance
britney spears picked up her first ever grammy for her song toxic which was named best dance recording
rod stewart also won the first grammy of his career getting the best traditional pop album award for stardust
the great american songbook volume iii
in 2003 stewart said he was astounded he had never won a grammy  but they tend not to give it to the british unless youre sting
there were few other highprofile british victors this year
annie lennox metal group motorhead and dance act basement jaxx all took home trophies
but elvis costello who had four nominations and joss stone and franz ferdinand who were both up for three awards got nothing
beach boys veteran brian wilson was another firsttime winner  for best rock instrumental performance
it represents triumph and achievement in music that i feel that i deserved and im really glad i won he said
a live recording of composer john adams 11 september tribute on the transmigration of souls performed by the new york philharmonic won three classical prizes
and former us president bill clinton picked up the second grammy of his career winning the spoken word award for the audio version of his autobiography my life

the original stars of swedish pop quartet abba have reunited for the home premiere of hit musical mamma mia which is based on the bands songs
it is the first time in almost 20 years that the four bjorn ulvaeus benny andersson agnetha faltskog and annifrid lyngstad have met publicly
faltskog has been a virtual recluse since the band split up in 1982
the musical which has become a global phenomenon will be performed in swedish for the first time
fans camped outside stockholms cirkus theatre in the snow for a glimpse of the stars
the premiere marks abbas first public reunion since the legendary bands acrimonious breakup in the early 1980s
it was thought that faltskog would appear in london for the musicals fifth anniversary celebrations in april 2004 but she stayed away due to her fear of flying
original abba member bjorn ulvaeus set about translating the musical into the bands mother tongue for the celebrated homecoming alongside swedish artist niklas stromstedt
almost all of abbas original songs which have sold more than 350 million records worldwide were written and recorded in english
the musical set on a small greek island tells of the story of a young woman and her fiercely independent single mother
the show will include such classics as super trouper sos and dancing queen
there are currently 14 productions being staged worldwide including new york and london with road shows in toronto south korea and madrid
more than 20 million people around the world have seen the show

a campaign has been launched to help independent labels get their music online and benefit from the growing trend for downloading music
the british phonographic industry has identified a lack of independent music available for download
we want to ensure that independent repertoire is as successful in the download world as it is in the physical world said bpi chief peter jamieson
downloaded singles have now overtaken physical singles in the uk
mr jamieson said his organisation was lobbying music service providers which include itunes and napster to urge them to promote independent releases
download sales are due to be incorporated into the uk singles chart later this year
with downloads shortly to be eligible for the singles chart this is a key commercial issue on which the bpi committed to assisting its members added mr jamieson
as part of the campaign the bpi is running a series of seminars entitled getting your music online focusing on how independent labels can embrace digital music
the us has already begun incorporating download sales in the billboards hot 100 chart

black sabbath have topped a list of the best british rock albums of all time
the band once fronted by ozzy osbourne led a poll of kerrang magazine readers with their 1970 selftitled debut
the band have three more efforts on the list including fifthplaced paranoid
osbourne appears more than any other act with two solo records featured
the top five includes led zeppelin iron maiden and sex pistols
queen muse manic street preachers and the clash complete the top 10
a mix of heavy metal punk glam rock and even dance music makes up the list
motorhead judas priest and prodigy are included along with newer acts like the darkness and lostprophets
kerrang editor ashley bird said its amazing to see so many incredible homegrown albums in one list and without any of the abysmal fashion bands that currently clog up the music scene
these are the real opinions of proper rock fansformed by four teenage friends in the west midlands in the late 1960s black sabbath are one of britains most successful heavy rock bands
their debut was a uk top 10 hit in 1970 and sold more than a million copies in the us
osbourne said the bands success in the kerrang poll was a triumph for british rock
he said back then youd hear if you go to san francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair
we lived in aston birmingham
the only flowers i ever saw were on a gravestone in our local cemetery despite being disliked by many critics black sabbaths subsequent albums included multimillion sellers but internal rows led to osbourne leaving in 1979
the band continued without osbourne who went on to solo success but also had to battle alcoholism and legal action over his music allegedly inciting teenagers to commit suicide
he was eventually cleared of the charges
osbourne who bit off the head of a live bat on stage in 1982 rejoined the band to play the live aid charity concert in 1985
after many changes in lineup the original four members reunited to play live dates in 1997
black sabbath have reunited regularly in recent years while osbourne has gone on to wider fame with his family through mtv documentary series the osbournes

singer george michael has said that a new film about his life is the start of a retirement from public view
the pop star said it would be a much more behind the scenes affair and called his own genre of music dead
i thought i should explain myself before i disappear said michael who was at the berlin film festival to launch the documentary
the film a different story chronicles michaels life and career from the 1980s and his personal struggles
the 41yearold charttopper told reporters in the german capital that he wanted to move his career into a different form but added that he does not know what it is going to be yet
im still going to be making music he said but added that he was not going to be around
he hinted at discontent with the current state of music industry and said i dont really think that there is anyone in the modern pop business who i feel i want to spar with michael said that the film directed by southan morris would put his two decades of fame into context
its almost as much for me as for my fans in terms of trying to make sense of the last 22 years and bring it to a close in a proper way he said
the documentary chronicles the highs and lows of his life in the public gaze from his meteoric rise as one half of pop duo wham to his arrest for lewd conduct in a los angeles toilet in 1998

the german music business  the third largest in the world  is in the state of a zombie because it has failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy a leading industry figure has said
tim renner the head of universal music germany until last year told bbc world services the music biz programme that the countrys music industry was now struggling to survive
renner warned that unless the industry accepted new realties  such as downloading  its decline could become irreversible
the problem the music industry has got is that they arent willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out he stated
so the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombiethe music market in germany peaked in 1997 with sales of 26bn euros £18bn
since 2000 sales have plummeted to just 16bn euros £11bn in 2003
in the space of one year  between 2002 and 2003  cd album sales fell by 138
but a study by the society for consumer research found that at the same time more than twice as many recordable cds had music recorded on them than cd albums were sold
mr renner pointed out that because profit comes mainly from the longevity of a goodselling record this was particularly damaging
you need time he added
however peter zombic the managing director of the international federation of phonographic industry in germany said he did not feel the situation was as dramatic as mr renner believed
its quite true that we have severe problems in germany  but thats true in other parts of the world and in most developed markets too he argued
we have a severe problem with piracy especially internet piracy and we also have a severe problem of private copying
i dont agree that the music industry lost control over the music market  in fact especially in regard to germany talent the market is quite successful he did however admit that copyright owners have partly lost control of their copyright due to piracy and copying
but he refuted suggestions that the industry had been too slow to respond to digital downloading
we were the first to implement a download service  back in 1997 he argued
at that time it was not successful because of the advent of piracy  it was the napster time when p2p services became popular
it still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero as far as the illegal product is concerned mr zombic also called for a change to the perception in germany that private copying of music is not a problem
german law does allow people to make copies of cds for their family and close friends without fear of breaking copyright
mr zombic said that this legal framework was a huge problem
there is a widespread attitude that private copying is a hobby its nice its fun he added
we try to make clear its not nice and its not fun  its endangering the creativity in our country

rock singer pete doherty has been involved in a fight with his bands guitarist at their biggest gig to date
babyshambles played for 5000 fans at londons brixton academy on tuesday
the former libertines singer traded blows with guitarist patrick walden
they were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set
the show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding
on monday doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court which he denies
he is out on £50000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 gmt curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the brixton gig
babyshambles which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the libertines played a warmup show at the garage north london on monday
on tuesday doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by mick jones the former clash guitarist who produced the libertines second album
babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 gmt launching into their last single killamangiro which reached number eight in december
but the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush
doherty appealed to fans to calm down saying theres a few people getting hurt down the front youve got to move backthe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect waldens guitar leading the pair to trade kicks and punches
bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage but returned after five minutes and finished their 50minute performance with no further trouble
doherty 25 had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew which is one of the conditions of his bail
on monday the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were not too regular an occurrence
the singer was arrested with fellow musician alan wass on 2 february after an alleged dispute with documentarymaker max carlish at a london hotel
they are next due in court on 18 april

the original stage production of the sound of music is to be performed for the first time in the austrian capital 40 years after the film was released
the first fullscale theatrical production of the musical will make its debut in vienna on saturday
julie andrews starred in the 1965 film version of the rogers and hammerstein classic set in the alpine country
but despite being one of the most successful musicals of all time it is barely known inside austria
the film was never shown in any cinema in austria and was not broadcast on television until the early 1990s
the musical is based on the true story of the von trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from nazioccupied austria in 1938
sensitivities about nazism during wartime austria and issues towards the von trapp family themselves could explain austrias reluctance to embrace the musical
another source of irritation for austrians is the song edelweiss which is considered an traditional folk song by many filmgoers
the song was actually an invention by rodgers and hammerstein
many also consider the film to portray a kitsch image of austria including yodelling goatherds and lederhosen
the production is being staged at a viennese opera house the volksoper beginning on saturday
maria the novice nun who falls in love with baron von trapp will be played by austroaustralian actress and singer sandra pires

the inclusion of downloaded music in the official singles chart has been delayed for a month
the british phonographic industry bpi had planned to include download formats in the chart from 20 march
but the date has been put back to 17 april to create a level playing field for independent labels
the bpi is concerned that independent repertoire is not adequately represented online and said they were looking at ways of rectifying it
bpi chairman peter jamieson said the inclusion of download formats in the official uk singles chart is the most significant development in the charts for 20 years
but for a multitude of reasons the current chart representation of independent repertoire at the major download outlets is poor
i am very pleased we have secured this delay on behalf of independents
we have to try and establish a realistic level playing field of opportunity
the official uk charts are run by the official uk charts company occ  a joint venture between the bpi and the british association of record dealers bard
at an occ board meeting on wednesday the occ board agreed with bpi members that the 20 march start date be postponed
download formats will now be included in the official uk singles chart for the first time in the chart published on 17 april  the sales week beginning 10 april

a us rapper awaiting trial for murder has filmed part of a music video in jail angering a sheriff who says he was tricked into letting tv crews in
cmurder a former member of rap group tru was filmed in his orange prison suit for the video for his yall heard of me single in a new orleans jail
he is awaiting a second trial after an original conviction was thrown out
im not pleased jefferson parish sheriff harry lee said
he will not make another video in my jail footage for the video was filmed by two crews who had permission to interview cmurder  one from court tv and one from a local cable show
but mr lee said he did not know the rapper had filmed the video and made an album behind bars and said he was fooled into letting the cameras in
the rappers lawyer ron rakosky said the bottom line is we didnt do anything wrong mr rakosky said it was better than cmurder real name corey miller just sitting there wasting away
heres a guy in jail making constructive use of his time instead of withering away he said
hes lost more than three years of his life locked up for a crime he did not commitbut local group victims and citizens against crime said he should not be working behind bars
he is a suspect in a murder case
i dont think he should be allowed these privileges especially earning money until his name is totally cleared the groups president beverly siemssen said
in 2003 cmurder was found guilty of killing a 16yearold in a nightclub but that decision was thrown out last april
he is now facing a second trial on a charge of seconddegree murder
with two brothers in the group tru he had two us top 10 albums in the late 1990s before going solo when he scored another three top 10 albums

bill contis job of musical director of the oscars show is not for the fainthearted since conducting the orchestra is the ultimate platespinning assignment
this year marks contis 17th turn at the helm of the academy awards orchestra
the excitement is a live performance as a musician he says
all of your colleagues everyone in the film industry is in the theatre
all the important people
i guess its just a television show but we always think its a bit more the orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average oscars show
as well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house
its a very busy evening it takes a certain amount of preparation of music orchestrating sketching rehearsing before the show
but you dont know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director its exciting explains conti
and much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed
we dont know who the winners will be
so when they say the winner is we have five different pieces of music in front of us they say the name we play the appropriate one immediately adds conti
the orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches despite being told to be brief by the shows producers
the decision to drown out or kill the offending star with music is relayed from the directors box to the orchestra via contis earpiece
i dont feel good about it at all
its not my call though he says
when the director says music the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall
we dont usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off
the person thats been cut off whos 10 feet from me is glaring at me like its death time on occasions some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak
julia roberts when she came on she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do he says
conti received an oscar in 1983 for the original score of the right stuff
he also received two nominations in the original song category in 1976 for gonna fly now from rocky and in 1981 for the title song from for your eyes only
its a moment in the sun he says
when people get up there some people this is hard to believe people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining might get a little flustered
but theres this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and theyre either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever metthe image of the oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories
behind the scenes the key players such as conti have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with
theres a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls
i can control hearing in my ears the left ear or the right ear  different things at different times
i have to communicate with the director
i have a little microphone thats attached to my headset
to open up that microphone i have a footswitch he explains
contis most nervewracking moment came during his first oscars show as musical director in 1977 when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke
conti immediately told the shows director i start cursing and screaming i tell him were not going to die for this show  you must do something or im going to climb out of this pit with 60 musicians and were going to be home in 10 minutes
oh no bill dont do anything came the response
imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra 60 or so of them in the pit and while were playing firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke the smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands
no one died its not a big story but it was scary at the time laughs conti
when the ceremony is over the music director attends the annual governors ball with his family
i have a drink and relive the show he says
im not for too much carousing
i go home and unwind
it takes me about a day
church ministers are trying to prevent rapper nelly performing in arkansas saying they do not want his vile and filthy lyrics in their town
more than 20 jonesboro ministers urged music fans to boycott nellys 12 march concert at arkansas state university in a bid to have it cancelled
jonesboro is a wonderful city because of what does not come here said the reverend adrian rodgers
but a venue spokesman said more than 5500 tickets had been sold so far
mr rodgers of the fullness of joy church said he was concerned about the rappers lyrics that include references to drugs sex and violence and songs that the minister said were demeaning to women
ministers were worried that bringing such acts to jonesboro would lead to problems
tear the tickets up mr rodgers said
do not go and do not allow your children to gotim dean director of the arkansas state university venue said ticket sales had been brisk
it would appear that with ticket sales over 5000 many others have expressed their right to find nellys music entertaining and worth spending their time and money on he said
nelly has sold more than 30 million singles and albums worldwide and in september 2004 simultaneously occupied the number one and two positions in the us albums chart
he has had 12 uk hit singles including hot in herre dilemma and recent number one over and over

us rap star 50 cent has said he has thrown protege the game out of his gunit gang in a feud that has apparently involved two shootings
in a radio interview on monday 50 cent said the newcomer was disloyal in conflicts with other rappers
a man was shot in the thigh outside new yorks hot 97 studios while 50 cent was on air
more shots were fired outside his management offices two hours later
50 cent appeared on the games debut album which was number one in the us
50 cent whose second album is about to be released after his debut made him one of hiphops biggest stars has been involved in recent rivalries with fellow artists including fat joe nas and jadakiss
he has claimed credit for the success of the game who has become the hottest new star on the rap scene
both were drug dealers and were shot before turning to music
in an interview with hot 97 on saturday the game described some of 50 cents rivals as my friends and said he would not turn on them
nas is one of my friends and jadas really a homie he said
50s beef is 50s beef and i really dont know where all this stems from when 50 cent appeared on the same station two days later he said the game was no longer a member of gunit
every record hes selling is based on me being on his record with him he said
when the shooting took place outside the studio the interview was ended and the rapper was escorted out of the building by security personnel
an unidentified 24yearold los angeles man is stable with a gunshot wound to the upper thigh
police say the games associates may have heard the interview and gone to the studio where they confronted 50 cents entourage
officers are also investigating a later shooting in which eight bullets were fired into the door of 50 cents management company violator
no arrests have been made in relation to either incident
50 cents second album the massacre is released on thursday five weeks after the games debut documentary went to number one
elliott wilson editorinchief of hiphop magazine xxl said the feud would boost publicity for 50 cents release
it helps him obviously in terms of exposure
you cant ask for better promotion he said
but he added i think hes making more and more enemies
you definitely feel like is he doing too much of a tupac spiral like me against the world
you bring more people wanting to see you fail tupac shakur was shot dead in 1996

dj duo jk and joel are taking over bbc radio 1s flagship chart show on sunday adding showbiz news celebrity interviews and betweensong banter
they hope to boost ratings for the longrunning show which has been overtaken in popularity by independent radios hit 40 uk rundown
radio 1s chart show is an institution and remains the stations single most popular show says jk also known as jason king
for years people have been tuning in at four oclock with their tape recorders ready to record their favourite tunes
not that i ever did that
but things have moved on a lot now so it was time for a changethat change involved ejecting previous host wes butters and relocating king and dj partner joel ross from their weekend afternoon radio 1 slot
the pair have worked together for a decade  meeting on viking radio in hull before moving to manchester station key 103 and winning two sony radio awards
they also presented gadget series playboyz and car show motor maniacs for cable tv channel granada men and motors and pure soap on bbc three
on the revamped chart show their cheeky laddish banter will punctuate star interviews and competitions film and dvd charts plus a look at future single releases in addition to the singles chart itself
the chart rundown is no longer the only point of the programme says ross
the show used to be the only way to discover who was in the top 40
now you can just click on the internet to find that out so the show has plenty of extra items too the shows reduced reliance upon the top 40 also reflects the fact that music fans are now more likely to download songs in digital format rather than buy them on compact disc vinyl or cassette
i personally buy downloads rather than cd singles says 27yearold ross
even my grandma can download songs now
jk is still struggling with the technology though but its premature for people to say that the singles chart is dead ross adds
while sales of singles on traditional formats are down interest in songs has been revived by download sales which will be incorporated into our main chart rundown from april
music fans still want to know what is the most popular song of the weekross will be plumping for chart success from rapper verbalicious and the stereophonics on sunday while king is more of an rb and dance music fan
so listeners will get the advantage of both our music tastes says king 30 who describes outgoing host butters as an extremely professional and competent broadcaster
the advantage joel and i have is that were a double act with a rapport between us that makes the show much more interactive king says
wes has a great broadcasting career ahead of him
and if not i could always use a cleaner he jokes
ross says the pair have done their best to ignore the weight of expectation placed upon the revamped show
other people can worry about that we are going to continue doing what we do well he says
at the end of the day this is a radio show that is meant to be entertaining
nobody died

musicians groups are to tackle us visa regulations which are blamed for hindering british acts chances of succeeding across the atlantic
a singer hoping to perform in the us can expect to pay 1300 £680 simply for obtaining a visa
groups including the musicians union are calling for an end to the raw deal faced by british performers
us acts are not faced with comparable expense and bureaucracy when visiting the uk for promotional purposes
nigel mccune from the musicians union said british musicians are disadvantaged compared to their us counterparts
a sponsor has to make a petition on their behalf which is a form amounting to nearly 30 pages while musicians face tougher regulations than athletes and journalists
if you make a mistake on your form you risk a fiveyear ban and thus the ability to further your career says mr mccune
the us is the worlds biggest music market which means something has to be done about the creaky bureaucracy says mr mccune
the current situation is preventing british acts from maintaining momentum and developing in the us he added
the musicians union stance is being endorsed by the music managers forum mmf who say british artists face an uphill struggle to succeed in the us thanks to the tough visa requirements which are also seen as impractical
the mmfs general secretary james seller said imagine if you were an orchestra from the orkneys every member would have to travel to london to have their visas processedthe us market is seen as the holy grail and one of the benchmarks of success and were still going to fight to get in there
its still very important but there are other markets like europe india and china added mr seller
a department for media culture and sport spokeswoman said were aware that people are experiencing problems and are working with the us embassy and record industry to see what we can do about it a us embassy spokesman said we are aware that entertainers require visas for timespecific visas and are doing everything we can to process those applications speedily we are aware of the importance of cultural exchange and we will do our best to facilitate that he added

british actress antonia bernath is making her debut in kisna  the warrior poet marking a growing trend for nonindian stars to appear in bollywood films
directed by bollywood veteran subhash ghai the film is set in the british raj and bernath plays an army generals daughter who falls in love with a rural boy kisna
i liked the fluid nature of filmmaking
we improvised quite a lot says bernath
at times it felt very chaotic but mr ghai was quite clear about what he wanted picked from more than 200 girls in an audition in london bernath cut short her education at bristols old vic theatre school to take up the opportunity
it is not often that somebody gets to play the lead role straight out of a drama school
she spent three weeks learning hindi and taking dance lessons
initially i was a bit sceptical about how people would respond to me bernath says
but i found the hindi film industry very warm and encouraging
i even had a few offers before the work on kisna was completedfilms are one of indias biggest exports and those like lagaan and monsoon wedding have broken the traditional boundaries of colour and culture
spurred by this bollywood producers are trying to go global in all aspects of filmmaking be it technical or artistic
from young heartthrobs like nick moran of lock stock and two smoking barrels to model sophie dahl many nonindian stars want to make the most of this opportunity
bollywood has truly gone global says taran adarsh editor of indian film journal trade guide
directors are now attempting to woo nonasian audience to increase their share in the overseas film market kisna has been shot simultaneously in hindi and english with the english print shortened by an hour to accommodate the western audience
the film even has a song composed in english by ar rahman the director of the popular west end musical bombay dreams
identification is a popular cinematic device
use of european or american actors can be viewed as a step in that direction says adarsh
the cast of kisna also includes british actors michael maloney caroline langrishe and polly adams
another actress annabelle wallace plays the lead role in a bilingual romantic comedy dil jo bhi kahey whatever the heart says which also stars indian screen legend amitabh bachchan
actor and producer aamir khans forthcoming venture the rising is set against the backdrop of the indian mutiny of 1857 with british actor toby stephens in a key role
but it isnt only the western actors looking eastwards
bollywood sweetheart aishwarya rai recently seen in bride and prejudice alongside new zealand actor martin henderson is building her international career
and many other bollywood stars have their eyes set on hollywood
hollywood or bollywood its the box office that determines whether something is a passing phase or a trend says adarsh
kisna  the warrior poet opens in the uk on 21 january

the number of british films produced in the uk fell 40 in 2004 with movies starring johnny depp and jude law among those affected screen daily has said
twentyseven british films were made in the uk last year following a drop in funding compared with 45 in 2003 according to the trade weekly
it attributed the drop to tighter tax laws and reduced funding from sources such as the national lottery
uk and us coproductions in britain fell from 102 in 2003 to 81 last year
last year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the uk
several projects were shelved as they faced the implications of this clampdown coupled with the reduction in movie funding from traditional sources including the lottery and miramax films
shooting on period drama tulip fever which was to star jude law and keira knightley was postponed indefinitely while shooting of the libertine starring johnny depp was moved to the isle of man
there isnt anything coming in to replace the funds said the libertines executive producer marc samuelson
we are in a hiatus films with medium budgets of up to £9m a similar level to box office hits vera drake calendar girls and enduring love are expected to be worst hit by the tax clampdown
the strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of us films shot in the uk during 2004 screen international added
big budget coproductions such as the harry potter series continued to be shot in the uk however
the uk film council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for british film production when bridget jones the edge of reason wimbledon and thunderbirds were all filmed in the uk
the drop was expected as there was no way 2003s record level of production could be bettered the councils spokesperson said
the reduction in indigenous film production in 2004 was due to a variety of factors including the continuing longterm trend towards coproduction of films in more than one country and changes to financing arrangements it was too early to predict whether the downward trend in uk production would continue throughout 2005 the uk film council said
in september the government introduced subsidies worth up to £4m per film for medium budget films under new treasury measures
it is also due to announce a replacement for uk film tax relief scheme section 48 in july

stan lee the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit spiderman movies
many marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches  a formula which revolutionised comics
born in 1922 to poor workingclass jewish immigrants from romania stan lieberman got a job in timely publications a company owned by a relative
he was assigned to the comics division and  thanks to a fertile imagination  rose to editor by the age of 18
for more than 20 years he was the ultimate hack  knocking out crime stories horrors westerns anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership
words of more than two syllables were discouraged
characters were either all good or bad with no shades of grey
so embarrassed was lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline
he assumed the dumb name stan lee now legally adopted
by the time he was 40 lee had decided he was too old for the comic game
his britishborn wife joan suggested he had nothing to lose and for his swansong should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create
after a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of batman superman and wonder woman timely needed to respond
lees answer in 1961 was the fantastic four  a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays
they were to change lees life and the comics industry forever
lee gave each character individual everyday teenage problems such as dandruff ingrown toenails and acne
they would frequently fall out with their parents and each other
the fan letters poured in
without immediately knowing it stan lee had ushered in the golden age of comics and his imagination was rekindled
his marvel universe spawned the new title of marvel comics
soon after nerdy peter parker was transformed  after a bite from an irradiated spider  into someone who could crawl up the sides of new yorks skyscrapers
spiderman was born
he was to become an icon of modern popular culture
spidey as he is affectionately known had quite extraordinary powers  yet he had problems at work at home and with his girlfriends
at last the teenager was no longer just the sidekick but the main hero
and the hero was no longer just brawn he had brains too
just because hes a hero and has super powers doesnt mean he doesnt have problems stan lee told the bbc
the incredible hulk the mighty thor iron man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse bigotry and social inequality
radically lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work
jack kirby frank miller john romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right
other superheroes broke new ground in other ways
daredevil was blind black panther was black and silver surfer pondered the state of humanity
lees influence remains
some years ago the marvel hero northstar came out of the closet
in its heyday marvel was selling 50 million copies a year
until he retired from editing in 1971 stan lee wrote all the copy for marvels covers
in 1999 his stan lee media venture aimed at marrying comicstrips with the internet went spectacularly wrong
lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud
in 2001 though he started a new company entitled pow purveyors of wonder entertainment which is currently developing films and television programmes
his latest project is a superhero based on a real person  jay j armes who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger
but his 40yearold creations are still as enduring as ever  with xmen the hulk and daredevil have all been turned into hollywood action movies in the last five years
but spiderman has been the biggest box office hit with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost 16bn £857m in ticket sales around the world  before dvd and merchandise sales are counted
it seems stan lee is as indestructible as his heroes

organisers of the third bangkok international film festival have been determined to carry on with this years event despite the ravages of the asian tsunami disaster
the festivities have been scaled down red carpets have been mothballed and profits from ticket sales are being donated to the tsunami relief fund
apart from this however the festival has continued as originally planned
when the disaster happened we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel said the festivals executive director craig prater
the decision was made that we would continue but that the focus would change
our premieres became fundraisers the opening night was visibly toned down and 10 of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund he continued
but we feel like weve turned a page
weve acknowledged our position and now its business as usualmr praters sentiments were echoed by christine rush director of the festivals sister event the bangkok film market
we have been careful to be respectful of the thai nations recovery from this terrible disaster she said
however the nations recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life
we are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out she added
given the conspicuously low audience figures that support may be more symbolic than significant
however poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficulties
the eclectic programme contains a wide range of titles including such oscar hopefuls as ray charles biopic ray and mike leighs abortion drama vera drake
that said the absence of thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers
on a more positive note the celebrity guests attending the event have generated huge media interest in this busy capital city
problems securing air transport the clash with last sundays golden globes ceremony in los angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancel
but the festival has still attracted such hollywood directors as oliver stone and joel schumacher alongside such screen stars as michael douglas jeremy irons and jeanclaude van damme
irons whose film being julia is in competition for the festivals golden kinnaree awards said he had wondered whether he should attend after decembers catastrophe
i questioned whether i should come when such a tragedy had happened the british actor said
i thought it might be in rather bad taste
but then i spoke to the organisers and i was encouraged to let life go on
now ive come here im very glad
what impresses me about thai culture is they get over these things far quicker than we do in the west he continued
basically i was invited here by thailand
if they still want you to come you shouldnow in its third year bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar
and while it has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in hong kong tokyo and pusan in south korea mr prater predicts it will soon become their equal
its grown awfully fast in three years  maybe too fast he concedes
weve had some bumps in the road but thats only because the festival is still a baby
i have no doubt in my mind that in five years this will be the top asian film festival in the world the golden kinnarees will be awarded on friday
the festival itself runs until 24 january

the bbc is to invest £9m in developing new comedy and entertainment programmes outside london
the changes come as part of a shakeup of several departments to create shows that appeal to a wider range of people
changes are also being made to teams in the factual and daytime departments outside london
director of television jana bennett said the changes were about getting the best ideas on screen as efficiently and effectively as we can
the new structure in each genre is designed to ensure that happens she said
a number of new roles are being created in each department including a head of comedy commissioning based in glasgow
the new person will be in charge of the £9m budget and their role will be to develop shows outside the capital both within the bbc and with independent production companies
jane lush controller of entertainment commissioning said entertainment and comedy are incredibly important to our audiences im confident these changes will help us get the very best programmes on screen similar positions will also be created in the other departments with the new commissioning editor for documentaries based in bristol and the daytime commissioning editor in birmingham
ms bennett said the new roles would benefit those making programmes within the bbc as well as those making shows for the channel independently
a strong independent sector and a flourishing inhouse production base are not mutually exclusive and will stimulate the competition that will deliver the best ideas to the audience she said

the 77th annual academy awards are taking place on 27 february with the stars of the moviemaking world once again holding their breath to discover who will be showered with the honours this year
but from humble beginnings how did the modern day extravaganza become the behemoth it is todayhow it all started the first academy awards were handed out in 1929 at a comparatively lowkey dinner held at the hollywood roosevelt hotel  just over the road from their modern day home
just 250 guests attended with ticket prices at 5
the first film to win was wings which starred clara bow in the only silent movie to win the big award
for the first 10 years or so the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm but in 1940 the winners were published in the los angeles times at 845pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results
as a result the sealed envelope system was introduced leading to the secrecy and suspensefilled night that happens today
when and where the tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until 1942 but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinner
the ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous graumans chinese theatre the first to host the expanded event
other venues included the dorothy chandler pavilion and the shrine auditorium
they are now held at the kodak theatre which opened in 2002 just across the road from its original home and holds 6000 people
until 1954 they were held on a thursday then swapped around from monday to wednesday before sunday night was settled on although the month swapped from may to april to march and now its current month of february
the first televised ceremony was in 1953 with bob hope as the mc
who was oscar there is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as oscar
one popular story is that academy librarian margaret herrick said the statue looked like her uncle oscar
a journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article
the first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist sidney skolsky used it to describe katherine hepburns first best actress win in 1934
the academy officially adopted the nickname in 1939
the trophy was designed by mgm art director cedric gibbons
since its inception 2530 oscars have been handed out
in support of the war effort the academy handed out plaster oscar statuettes during wwii
after the war winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing
fiftyfive statues were stolen in en route to the awards in 2000 52 were recovered nine days later
winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out
who sits in judgement the academy was set up in 1927 as a nonprofit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines
douglas fairbanks sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards
there are now 5700 members of the academy  with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers
some of the criteria for admittance includes film credits that reflect the high standards of the academy receipt of an academy award nomination achievement of unique distinction earning of special merit or making an outstanding contribution to film
the stars who left emptyhanded while many of the biggest films and moviemakers have been honoured by the academy there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics
among the overlooked films were hobsons choice dirty harry the 39 steps the searchers and king kong
actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included al jolson in the jazz singer 1927 humphrey bogart in casablanca 1944 gene kelly in singing in the rain 1952 and henry fonda in 12 angry men 1957
alfred hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations
his enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in 1968
the show always goes on not even war has halted the glittering hollywood event
there were calls for it to be cancelled in 2003 during the war in iraq but as it didnt stop during world war ii or the vietnam war
documentary winner michael moore ensured nobody forgot about the iraq war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the american invasion
the ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses
the ceremony has been postponed on three occasions
los angeles floods in 1938 saw it put back a week
the death of martin luther king saw it postponed for two days in 1968 as a mark of respect and there was a 24hour delay following the assassination attempt on president ronald reagan
controversies and other gaffes three people have refused oscars including actor george c scott who said the whole thing was demeaning
writer dudley nichols refused his academy award in 1935 for his screenplay for the insider because the writers guild was striking at the time
marlon brando turned down his best actor oscar for the godfather in 1973 in protest as hollywoods apparent discrimination against native american people
he sent along a woman called sacheen littlefeather to collect his award
she was later revealed to be native american actress maria cruz
the following year robert opal interrupted proceedings when he streaked flashing a peace sign as well as everything else
the tv network managed to pan away and avoid too much nudity
opal was murdered in 1979
frank capra was the butt of one major gaffe in 1934 when the host opened out best picture envelope and declared come on up and get it frank to which frank capra bounded up to the stage before realising that he had meant frank lloyd had won for cavalcade
capra vowed he would never to go the awards again but went the following year to collect his award for it happened one night

hollywood legend dustin hoffman has hit out at the quality of current films and theatre productions
the star of rain man and tootsie said the film culture was in the craphouse at a press conference on tuesday
the 67yearold also said he stopped working a few years ago because he lost his spark for acting
hoffman is in the uk to publicise his new comedy meet the fockers which also stars robert de niro barbra streisand and ben stiller
he said you go to the cinema and you realise youre watching the third act
there is no first or second act
there is this massive filmmaking where you spend this incredible amount of money and play right to the demographic
you can tell how much money the film is going to make by how it does on the first weekend
the whole culture is in the craphouse
its not just true in the movies its also true in the theatre
broadway and now london is the same special effects are in great demand
its not a good time culturallyhoffman also said he stopped working a few years ago and moved into directing and writing
he said i just lost that spark i always had
a couple of years ago i didnt like the parts i was getting
studios werent interested in the kind of films that people of my generation wanted to see
i thought i would stop and just try writing and directing
i wasnt aware of the depression that set in recently hoffmann has returned to film with roles in i heart huckabees finding neverland and now meet the fockers which is the sequel to meet the parents
meet the fockers opens in the uk on friday

johnny depp whose latest role was peter pan creator jm barrie in finding neverland is celebrated as one of hollywoods most maverick talents
depp has become an unlikely major star given his preference for taking dark and idiosyncratic roles instead of surefire box office hits
he has had a longrunning working relationship with the equally unconventional director tim burton
depp was born in kentucky in 1963 and at first wanted to be a rock star playing in a number of bands and supporting acts such as iggy pop and the b52s in florida
on a visit to los angeles his former wife introduced him to actor nicolas cage
in 1984 he started his film career playing a doomed teenager in horror film nightmare on elm street
two years later he played a soldier in oliver stones vietnam epic platoon
but it was tv that first made depp a star
he played undercover cop tommy hanson in the us series 21 jump street for three years from 1987
in 1990 he began his partnership with burton in the dark fairy tale edward scissorhands about a young man with blades for hands
he won plaudits in 1993 for the downbeat film whats eating gilbert grape where he played a sensitive youth looking after an overweight mother and a retarded younger brother played by leonardo dicaprio
another role under burton ed wood starred depp as the crazed cult filmmaker wood in 1994
he played a much more serious sensitive role in his next major film donnie brasco where he portrayed an undercover cop infiltrating a mafia ring
in 1997 he directed his only film to date  the brave the story of an indian man offered money to appear in a snuff film
two years later he played hunter s thompson in terry gilliams ambitious but poorlyreceived big screen adaptation of fear and loathing in las vegas
he worked again with tim burton in the 1999 horror film sleepy hollow and appeared opposite dame judi dench and juliette binoche in chocolat
his performance in pirates of the caribbean which earned him golden globe and bafta nominations had many critics thinking he based it upon the mannerisms of his friend rolling stones guitarist keith richards
his latest role in finding neverland explored jm barries relationship with sylvia kate winslet and her children
depps charismatic performance drew an audience of adults and children alike into barries vivid imagination and he was called the fifth child of the group by the films director marc forster
he has two children of his own with french singer vanessa paradis having previously been in a longterm relationship with british model kate moss
the theme of childrens literature in depps career  and his long association with tim burton  are set to continue in his next role playing willy wonka in a remake of roald dahls classic charlie and the chocolate factory
british tv comedy fans might also remember depps guest role in the final episode of bbc sketch programme the fast show cited as his favourite show
it was another surprise move in depps varied and intriguing career

the uk cd albums market grew by 45 in 2004 with a record 1746 million units sold
on average every briton buys 32 cds per person per year
around 26000 albums are released in the uk each year making britain second only to the us in terms of the number of releases

mike leighs film vera drake will lead british hopes at this years academy awards after getting three nominations
imelda staunton was nominated for best actress for her role in the abortion drama while leigh received nods for best director and original screenplay
kate winslet was also nominated in the best actress category for her role in eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
and clive owen and sophie okonedo both got nominated for supporting roles in closer and hotel rwanda respectively
owen has already been made bookmakers favourite for best supporting actor for the role in closer that has already clinched him a golden globe award
and it is the first nomination for actress okonedo chosen for her performance in hotel rwanda about the 1994 rwandan genocide
it is also a debut nomination for staunton 49 who told bbc news 24 she had not thought the film would appeal to academy voters
it was an extraordinary time making the film and i cant believe what has happened this morning she said
i hope it just shows mike up to be the extraordinary filmmaker he is
we are also dealing with a very difficult subject matter and it is amazing to have it accepted in this way leigh who had previously received three oscar nominations for secrets and lies and topsy turvy told bbc news 24 the latest success was amazing
he said we hoped that imelda staunton would get a nomination but i never expected to get director and screenplay
its just absolutely wonderful
i think people are aware that its about life  and i hope it is the warmth and compassion that really talks to people winslet said she was ecstatic about the fourth nomination of her career
being nominated means so much to me
to be nominated for a film that was released a while ago i feel so honoured and overwhelmed she said
john woodward chief executive of the uk film council said it was extremely heartening to see british filmmaking talent recognised on the global stage

catalina sandino moreno has joined a rare group of actresses who have been nominated for an oscar for starring in a foreign language film
the colombianborn actress was the final hope for director joshua marston who scoured the us and colombia for a lead for maria full of grace
the film sees the 23yearold play a teenage drug mule who smuggles heroin by swallowing pellets in condoms
plaudits have been raining down on her for her gritty performance making it all the more surprising that this is her first film
her previous acting experience was in amateur productions in her home city of bogota at the ruben di pietro theatre academy
she has already received a nomination for the independent spirit awards leading actress category but these rarely overlap with academy awards instead recognising quirkier lowbudget films
and at the 2004 berlin film festival the jury could not choose between her and charlize therons oscar winning performance in monster so gave them a tied award
sandino moreno is now being regarded as one of the most promising actresses around at the moment
but she is taking her time committing to her next project hoping to land a strong spanish script and would love to be able to work with directors pedro almodovar or alejandro amenabar

film actress annette bening is up for an oscar for her starring role in the awardwinning film being julia
bening who was born in texas in 1958 has gained prominence for a string of key roles
although an oscar has so far eluded her her status as one of hollywoods favourite actresses remains solid
one of the biggest oscars buzzes in recent years was for benings role as troubled carolyn burnham in 1999s american beauty
but her deliciously neurotic portrayal of surburban life turning sour was overlooked in favour of hilary swanks leading role in boys dont cry
after opening her career in the theatre  and gaining a tony award nomination in 1986  bening had a lowkey spell in television
she then made her film debut as a sexstarved wife in 1988s the great outdoors opposite comics dan akroyd and john candy
following a cameo in postcards from the edge benings breakthrough role came in 1990 playing seductive con artist myra langtry in the grifters  a role that won her an oscar nomination
despite some rave reviews bening did not win the best supporting actress academy award
however the highprofile performance enabled bening to capture roles in a number of big budget hollywood productions costarring with some of hollywoods greatest players including robert de niro and harrison ford
but it was her role opposite warren beatty in 1991 gangster flick bugsy which had the greatest impact
bening played virginia hill another role which won her high critical acclaim but the film only picked up two of a staggering 12 oscar nominations
bugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for bening  she married beatty with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in europe
the couple now have four children together
a pair of contrasting yet successful performances peppered benings career in the mid1990s
she played michael douglas opposite number in romantic comedy the american president and as a fiery queen elizabeth i in a contemporary adaptation of shakespeares richard iii
bening was the first choice to play the female lead in american beauty director sam mendes film debut which was a critical and commercial success  but the actress had to be content with a bafta award for her strong performance
but current film being julia has made bening an awardwinning actress rather than the perennial nominee with success at the golden globes
the witty tale of revenge and love set in 1930s london sees the eponymous theatrical diva  played by bening  grow tired of her success and fall for a young american  and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted academy award

the oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer less contentious cinema
if best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches two of the frontrunners would have had to be michael moores bushbaiting documentary fahrenheit 911 and mel gibsons the passion of the christ
both films polarised opinion but had critics talking and the public turning up to see them  fahrenheit 911 breaking us box office records for a documentary and the passion of the christ making more than us370m £196m in the us alone
but this years academy awards have shied away from the big name controversies with the passion of the christ  a film accused of being antisemitic  receiving nominations only in the minor categories of cinematography makeup and musical score
fahrenheit 911 has also been overlooked despite winning the palme dor at the cannes international film festival in 2004
moores caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors decision to enter it in the best picture category rather than best documentary says tim dams the news editor of trade magazine screen international
but he also believes the strong political viewpoint of moores film does not sit well with the academy
if you look at past oscar winners and nominees the very conservative oscar voters tend to go for very conservative epicstyle pictures
fahrenheit 911 didnt really fit in to that category
they tend to go for films like titanic gladiator and the lord of the rings films with scale that often arent too contentious he said
while he said the oscar voting panel were not snubbing moores film he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category
i think its more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub he said
the problem with mel gibsons film he believed was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in aramaic an ancient middle eastern language
hollywood doesnt tend to like foreignlanguage films  noones ever tried doing a film in a dead language he said
but aside from these two films some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations
the german film the downfall a biopic tracing the final days of nazi leader adolf hitler in his berlin bunker has been recognised in the best foreign film category
the film has caused some controversy in showing hitler as a fallible but human man rather than a semimythical historical monster
but mr dams said its not an inflammatory film
it has done very well in germany and its a film that portrays hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster another contentious film mr dams said has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm
independent filmmaker morgan spurlock may have forced fastfood giant mcdonalds to withdraw its super size portions in the us after he went on a monthlong diet eating nothing but mcdonalds meals  and filmed his progress
the film has been a hit around the world
mr dams said its a political film but its quite fun and punky and wellpaced
morgan spurlock is a really likeable guy
its a very accessible film and it doesnt beat you over the head with its views
while in fahrenheit 911 there are moments of comedy i think the way that super size me is put together  the fact its a very likeable film  means its won through on charm dams pick at this years oscars the aviator martin scorseses biopic of aviation pioneer and hollywood player howard hughes

actress nicole kidman has won a restraining order against two paparazzi photographers who she claims left her fearful of leaving her sydney mansion
the oscarwinning star took action against jamie fawcett and ben mcdonald after a bugging device was found outside her home earlier this week
lawyers for the pair denied allegations they had planted the device
the australian actress is currently in sydney to film her latest movie eucalyptus with russell crowe
kidman was prompted to take action following a reported highspeed car chase with members of the paparazzi in sydney last weekend
according to local newspaper the daily telegraph the incident involved paparazzi driving through red lights and on the wrong side of the road in pursuit of kidmans vehicle
lawyers for mr fawcett and mr mcdonald denied that the pair were involved in the chase
kidman sought the apprehended violence orders  normally used in australia in cases of domestic violence and similar incidents  after being advised to do so by local police
nicole would like to make it clear that she acknowledges she is a public figure and that reporters and photographers have a job to do and she respects that said kidmans publicist wendy day
however these are specific actions against two individuals who over a period of time have caused her to feel threatened intimidated and unable to leave her home without fearing for her safety magistrate lee gilmore who issued the restraining order at waverley local court in sydney said she understood the photographers were entitled to earn a living but there had to be limits to their behaviour
miss kidman says shes willing to put up with some of it but its gone beyond that she said
i do believe the allegation in relation to the driving is a serious issue

a best director prize for mike leigh and best british film are also likely and it could steal some awards from heavilynominated competitors the aviator and finding neverland mr jolin tipped another contender  most likely the aviator  to walk away with the bafta for best film and added that finding neverland had been lavished with nominations but not trophies
strong oscar contenders million dollar baby and sideways did not figure in the bafta nominations giving vera drake greater potential to walk away with the big prizes
there is a sense that this film is ours and we should slap our own guys on the back
out of all the films in the running for the baftas vera drake is the true blue british oneif mike leigh is going to win awards for anything it should be vera drake at this years baftas said mr jolin adding that the film was probably his most technically accomplished and lavish work yet
mr jolin also tipped phil davis for a best supporting actor prize for his role in vera drake but felt that heather craney could be outdone by kate winslet or natalie portman in the supporting actress category
if there is anywhere where this film is going to win it will be at the baftas he said
the guardians film critic peter bradshaw felt that there might well be a sweep of awards for vera drake on saturday night
i hope that bafta voters will respond to the extremely high standard of acting from the whole cast of the film
if bafta cant do so what hope is there he said
mr bradshaw felt that mike leighs masterpiece was entitled to the best film award  leaving dead mans shoes harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban my summer of love and shaun of the dead to slug it out for the best british film trophy
i will be cheering if vera drake wins a whole host of awards he added

the new bigscreen version of the magic roundabout released in the uk on friday is the latest attempt to turn childrens television into boxoffice gold
recent years have seen a lessthansuccessful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbits five children and it previously filmed by the bbc in 1991
heman and transformers which were cartoon favourites in the 1980s will soon receive their own costly makeovers
with screen versions of the ateam the dukes of hazzard and even blakes seven on the cards nostalgia is clearly big business
but some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals
the new version of the magic roundabout which will be released as sprung in the us replaces the stopmotion models of the 1960s tv show with polished computergenerated animation
in a similar fashion the 2004 thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the originals puppets and models
the films are squarely pitched at younger audiences
pop stars robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voices in the magic roundabout while the nowdefunct boy band busted performed the thunderbirds theme song
but while some reviewers have been won over there has nonetheless been a significant backlash
this cganimated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the 60s stopmotion roundabout a cult hit writes stella papamichael on the bbc movies site
and the recent puppet comedy team america world police was in part provoked by its directors outrage that gerry andersons thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins
dan jolin reviews editor of empire magazine says classic childrens tv shows have a builtin audience that make them ideal for reinvention
i can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today
but i think its backfiring
whats next  the clangers on some distant planet with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them despite thunderbirds disappointing global boxoffice performance  the film cost 42m £22m but only recouped 21m £11m  the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating
it can therefore be only a matter of time before some other tv favourites receive the hollywood treatment
after the success of garfield the movie britains shabby tabbysurely deserves his own film vehicle
with only 13 episodes made of the 1974 series there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat professor yaffle and the mice of the marvellous mechanical mouse organ
furry recyclershave already had one bigscreen outing  1977s wombling free
but with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback
advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the bbcs supernatural comedy
and the success of pirates of the caribbean must surely herald a comeback for tvs most popular cartoon buccaneer
it might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed
the magic roundabout is out in the uk on 11 february
how about bringing catweazle to the big screen he could give gandalf a run for his moneythundercats i loved it
should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put in it will bring my youth backget your hands off the clangers is nothing sacredmake a movie version of the banana splitswhat about keanu reeves and richard gere in a remake of the wooden tops or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandy
you forgot to mention the grearest of them all danger mouse but then again it couldnt be better than the original series could itits always nice to see these old toons rereleased but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie and the song i think ive been completely put off
just leave these classics alone as good memories
i think remakes are a good idea
as the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe
i believe this is the whole reason retro has become so popular
as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series
personally id like to see cartoons such as transformers thundercats and mask
get full hollywood remakes
leave them alone why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place the thunderbirds film was apalling not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson
love to see transformers with real actors and cgi
and make it at least a 15 rating
part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect
they were moody sarcastic and rather human
just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved
dougal never smiled like that films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place
i have fond memories of bod not least of which because i look like him and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film
its got all the right material for an american blockbuster  no plot and no story
bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two
its all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a new audience but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it
it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never going to live up to expectation
it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made are filmmakers running out of original ideasall i can say is bring back danger mouse probably the greatest kids show ever
i recently rewatched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in danger mouse that was completely lost on me when i was a child
there was a new captain pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back
again like so many of these nostalgia programmes the animation  this time computer created flatcell like animation  failed to match the originals cut out paper technique for inventiveness and was woefully inadequate
we live in a sampling world  the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration clipping sounds from 20 years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new
seems that the film and tv is doing the same now  its just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them rather than being daring and trying something new
it got to be mrbenn
the story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing if they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great
and who to play the lead role well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin
if its going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing a role similar to the pirates of the caribbean character
muffin the mule perhaps  after all grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you knowwhy cant the british film industry try making gerry andersons ufo or captain scarlet or saphire and steel or the tomorrow people
in todays media it seems the past is the future
tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes djs are sampling or reworking 70s and 80s music
even computer games from 1015 years ago are getting modern reworkings
personally i think it shows that no one has any originality any more why not just leave our mistyeyed nostalgia alone
mary mungo and midge
but of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs
plus would mary be more of a vicky pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block yeah but no but i wasnt even thereid like to see mr
benn with brad pitt in the title role
sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner
it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in todays filmmakers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia
there are plany of modern childrens book that would make excellent films or tv programmes why not use them instead of rehashing the pastmr
benn with rowan atkinson as the lead
would have loved to see dungeons  dragons made but unfortunately the film that it was made into didnt come up to scratch
the only one that isnt to be remade as yet is thundercats which id like to see
im an expat living in norway and i recently went through a period of buying the dvds of many of my favourite childrens programs for my 2 daughters
my dearest wish however is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen very scandinavian
rainbowi believe that childrens classics should be left well alone and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie popular among children because its original witty and modern
the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago
how about classics like chorlton and the wheelies rentaghost terrahawks bodoh the list could go on and onif a transformers movie is indeed on the cards then ill be the first one on amazon buying a copy eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch
repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price i dont care till then ill have to make do with the citreon c4 advert
id luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same
and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden superb childrens programme
could morph hold his own in a big screen movie or even jamie and the magic torchhmmmmm i could go on and on
danger mouse at 34 im showing my age
noggin the nog was one of the best childrens programs
the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that noone could approach oliver postgates wonderful voices
so in general leave well alone
the originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story
just imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in a remake of fingerbobs
the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more lifelike fingermousebob the builder postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire post and bricks
in the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns krusty and gobo
will they triumph or will they fail miserably find out this fall
one puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe 90
it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joes car
of course gerry andersons supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of bigscreen bigbudget action
it was only that thunderbirds the movie was targetted as a childrent movie that really let it down
after all the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves
its only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods isnt it id hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation  i love that done in a shed clunkiness and you couldnt recreate the magic
perhaps if the remakes were done in a look around you mockauthentic style i might be interested 
chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch that would be megathis regurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry  it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other peoples ideas because it guarantees to bring in the 
the same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material will young etc
the sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the shortterm
the fact that they will be forgotten in 6 months time is irrelevant eg
starsky  hutch hence the market is saturated with this mindless drivel but it can only be stopped if people stop buying iti pray they never do a remake of chorlton and the wheelies
im only 27 and dont remember the series from when it was on tv but have the set on dvd and its a classic
the fact its so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to todays stuff it looks amateurish
thats the appeal though its so innocent like chorlton himself and it would be a real shame if they did remake it

hollywood stars brought a touch of glamour to london on saturday for the biggest night in the british film calendar
cate blanchett leonardo dicaprio and richard gere were just some of the actors who attended the 2005 bafta film awards
they emerged from limos at leicester square to an uncertain british climate that threatened rain one moment and promised late winter sunshine the next

wearing a caramelcoloured floaty frock by the designer alexander mcqueen miller told reporters the red carpet experience was intense nervewracking and cold
the younger stars of british film were also represented in the shape of emma watson who plays hermione in the harry potter films
the 14yearold said she was hoping to meet dicaprio and keanu reeves but joked that they are probably a little too old for me
actor christian slater who is currently starring in one flew over the cuckoos nest in londons west end was greeted by cries of christian christian by the ever vocal crowd
keanu reeves who presented the best actress award said being on the red carpet was an exciting part of his job
it is always surreal and when it is nice it is nice he said
martin scorsese whose movie the aviator went on to win best film said being honoured in the uk meant a lot to him
he said i am a great admirer of british cinema since the 1930s and 40s up until now
they give me a new energy when i see the best coming out of england and every two or three years is a whole new cycle of tough and young filmmakers and even the older ones are making good films
to recognise me in this way is a great honour british actor clive owen who has won a golden globe and a bafta for his supporting role in closer said it meant a lot to be at the ceremony
he said just to be here really at the baftas

friends and family including actress ruby dee his wife of 56 years gathered at the riverside church on saturday
also present at the service was former us president bill clinton and singer harry belafonte who gave the eulogy
he would have been a very good president of the united states said mr clinton
like most of you here he gave more to me than i gave to himthe 87yearold was found dead last weekend in his hotel room in florida where he was making a film
police said that he appeared to have died of natural causes

before the midday funeral scores of harlem residents formed a queue outside the church to pay their respects to davis
it is hard to fathom that we will no longer be able to call on his wisdom his humour his loyalty and his moral strength to guide us in the choices that are yet to be made and the battles that are yet to be fought said belafonte himself an ardent civil rights activist who had been friends with davis for over 60 years
but how fortunate we were to have him as long as we did

leading actor edward fox is one of the men behind plans to reopen a swansea theatre thought to be wales oldest
the star of film and tv hits day of the jackal and edward and mrs simpson has joined forces with swanseaborn actordirector terry palmer
they will set up a charity to raise money to buy the palace theatre and hope to reopen it to audiences in summer 2006
it is estimated that £500000 is needed to buy the grade ii listed building
the palace theatre which will be known as the pavilion repertory theatre was sold to an undisclosed bidder at auction 13 months ago for £340000
before that it had been used as a nightclub for 10 years
oscarwinner sir anthony hopkins who was born in nearby port talbot made his professional debut there and charlie chaplin and lily langtry have also trodden its boards
fox told the south wales evening post that after visiting the theatre he was surprised by its beauty
a lot of money needs to be spent on it but all the bones are there  it just needs a beautiful skin he said
to call it a jewel is not an overestimation
there are not many theatres left like this
the hope for the immediate future is that we can attract enough people to come forward to allow it to prosper he told the newspaper
fox first found fame in the 1960s
one of his most memorable roles was as an assassin in the day of the jackal in 1973 and he won a tv bafta as the prince of wales in 1980 for edward and mrs simpson
he was brought on board to save the theatre by mr palmer a longstanding friend of 40 years
two years ago i decided to return to swansea and do something for the city said mr palmer
he said he was excited by the idea of running the palace as a charity where young actors could develop and with an annual shakespeare festival in the summer
if in five years time the theatre can function in all areas without me i shall be well satisfied having helped to create a vital living theatre for the city he added
keith poulton a business adviser from swansea has already committed an undisclosed amount of money to the project
we need at least £75000 to secure a deposit on the building and weve only got two months to do that said mr poulton
a few benefactors have expressed their interest and mr fox is going to give it an awful lot of time he added
last year roads around the theatre were cordoned off when masonry from its roof fell onto a car but engineers said they were happy that it was safe

super size me director morgan spurlock has won the writers guild of americas award for documentary feature writing
the oscarnominated film followed spurlock as he ate only mcdonalds fast food for an entire month
spurlock was given the award at a special ceremony at the roosevelt hotel in hollywood on tuesday
organisers said the rising popularity of documentary films led them to honour a writer for a documentary screenplay for the first time
producer brian grazer presented the award to spurlock and the films backers roadside attractions samuel goldwyn films and showtime independent films
spurlock set out to discover the effect of living on nothing but mcdonalds for a month upgrading to supersize portions when offered
the film followed his 25lb weight gain and the health effects on his body including his liver and cholesterol levels
mcdonalds announced it was to scrap its supersized meals last year but denied the move was as a result of the negative publicity created by spurlocks film
spurlock was given his award on the same day the european court of human rights ruled that two uk activists should have been given legal aid in their long fight against a mcdonalds libel action
helen steel and david morris from north london dubbed the mclibel two were found guilty in a 1990s trial of libelling the company in a leaflet they had been handing out at the end of the case the high court in london ruled mcdonalds had been libelled and awarded the company £60000 in damages later reduced to £40000 on appeal
but he found the leaflet was true in some aspects

the original version of horror prequel exorcist the beginning dropped by producers over claims it was not scary enough is to have its world premiere
the film directed by paul schrader will be screened on 18 march at the international festival of fantastic film in brussels
the psychological drama stars stellan skarsgard and foreruns the 1973 film
schrader was replaced by director renny harlin who made a new version of the film which debuted in 2004
the prequel project was originally announced in 2001 with actor liam neeson in the lead role and john frankenheimer as director
however frankenheimer pulled out in 2002 a month before he died
skarsgard then replaced neeson in the role of father merrin made famous by max von sydow in the 1973 film
principal footage was shot in morocco and rome at a reported cost of 32m
however in august 2003 it emerged that producers morgan creek were shelving schraders version of the film having complained it was not scary enough
as well as replacing schrader with harlin  the director behind die hard 2 and cliffhanger  the producers also changed most of the cast but swedish star skarsgard stayed in the merrin role
harlins film released in the uk in october 2004 received lukewarm reviews but went on to make over 76m £407m worldwide
the festival screening will be the first time that schraders film has been seen in public
reports that it will be released either in cinemas or on dvd have yet to be confirmed
other films at the festival in the belgium capital which runs from 1126 march include the us horror hit boogeyman and the forthcoming sequel ring 2 as well as a selection of films adapted from the works of jules verne

this years clutch of oscar nominees have been the least popular for 20 years according to box office figures
in the us the five nominated for best film have been seen by 50 fewer people than movies in previous years
while the awards are not based on box office popularity there is concern for the ratings of the televised ceremony
we dont have a titanic or a lord of the rings out there
i think its fair to say it does concern us a bit said academy executive director bruce davis
about 51 million people in the us have seen this years nominees compared with between 100 million and 118 million in recent years
the last time combined attendance was so low was in 1984 when amadeus beat the killing fields a passage to india places in the heart and a soldiers story to best picture when 41 million saw the five films
last years ceremony attracted the highest audience in four years as viewers tuned in to see lord of the ring return of the king sweep the board
and the show reaped its biggest audience in 1997 when titanic took home 11 oscars
the film had taken 500m £264m worldwide before the ceremony and eventually took 18bn £952m
eyeballs starring at the movie screen translates to eyeballs staring at the tv screen said paul dergarabedian of box office tracker exhibitor relations
people like to have a vested interest in what theyre watching
when titanic does 18bn in worldwide box office youve got a lot of people with a vested interest past years have also seen blockbusters such as saving private ryan forrest gump and ghost compete for oscars
the biggest box office hitter among this years nominees is the aviator which has taken 90m £48m in the us although takings in the uk have reached only £7m so far
lowbudget move sideways and finding neverland have so far grossed about 45m £24m each
the years biggest blockbusters do actually feature in the oscar nominees but in the animation category
shrek 2 and the incredibles took 436m £231m while the incredibles took 259m £137m
mel gibsons the passion of the christ which took 370m £196m in the us was largely ignored by academy voters
but many in the film industry do not equate award and box office success
i have never equated the academy awards with how much money a movie takes in said nikki rocco head of distribution at universal which released nominee ray

a major distributor of pirated dvds of bollywood films has been sent to prison for three years
jayanti amarishi buhecha from cambridge was found guilty of two trademark offences last month and sentenced at harrow crown court london on tuesday
buhecha who made £26000 per month from his illegal trade was called one of the biggest bollywood pirates in the uk by the sentencing judge
the british phonographic industry bpi worked for two years on the case
an operation was launched against buhecha in 2002 after complaints were received about his activities
the judge in the case which lasted seven days said that a heavy penalty was called for because of the enormous damage buhecha caused to legitimate business
fake dvds were manufactured in pakistan and malaysia and sold on wholesale to shops by buhecha who traded in conterfeit dvds in 2002 and 2003
in december 2002 he was stopped in his car by trading standards officers who uncovered 1000 pirated dvds and faked inlay cards printed with registered trademarks
despite being arrested and bailed buhecha was caught a second time at the end of 2003
his home and a lockup in cambridge were found to contain 18000 counterfeit dvds and further faked inlay cards
buhecha was previously a legitimate distributor of bollywood films but was suspended and sued by his employers for dealing in illegal copies of bollywood classic mohabbatein
legitimate bollywood film distributors have hailed the conviction as a major boost
bollywood music and film suffers piracy at the rate of 40 which is more than that suffered by mainstream productions
the bpi welcomed the news of the prison sentence but warned there are plenty of other active counterfeiters of bollywood films
the organisations antipiracy director david martin said the problem simply will not disappear with buhecha
others and more will take his place so its vital that keep up our efforts in this field
the film world and media may be wild about the oscars but cinemagoers and the tvviewing public are sick of watching award ceremonies according to some la film critics
bob strauss from the la daily news thinks there are just too many televised gatherings of stars showering praise on each other
he came up with a colourful but unprintable description for these glitzy events which roughly translates a celebrity lovein
this echoed the views of oscars host and comedian chris rock who whipped up a media storm for saying he rarely watched them calling award shows idiotic
as chris rock accurately said theyre about celebrity and fashion mr strauss said
the recent grammy music awards proved to be a ratings loser and it seems oscars organisers are determined not to go the same way
recently announced changes to the ceremony include lining up all five nominees on stage before announcing the winner
unsurprisingly this prompted press speculation that the changes were aimed at boosting flagging advertising revenue
but entertainment weeklys dave karger maintained the oscars only generated excitement outside the industry when a blockbuster such as titanic or lord of the rings was nominated
the near constant flow of us film awards representing directors actors and producers guilds also means few surprises are left by the time the oscar ceremony is upon us he said
a quick scan of the los angeles times and los angeles daily news bears this out  speculation about who will win seems to have ground to a halt
on thursday the times simply printed a picture of the plastic tents going up outside the kodak theatre to protect the red carpet from rain
variety and the hollywood reporter have also kept their focus firmly on industryrelated news while in the uk bets have closed on the best actor category with ray star jamie foxx a dead cert to win
screen internationals us editor mike goodridge thinks 2004s films have simply not grabbed the publics imagination
filmmakers havent produced films that people adore this year he said
they adored saving private ryan for example  people loved it and it made a ton of money
2004s films could be a reaction to 911  there was a realisation in america that things might not be so rosy after all
audiences dont necessarily want to see darker films such as million dollar baby aviator and finding neverland which end with casualty as to whether rock could pep up the awards the critics were not hopeful
mr strauss doubted whether rock would make an impact but added im all for lower ratings though  there are far more important things going on than the oscars mr karger said the comic might boost younger viewers but mike goodridge thought rocks humour could prompt americas conservative states to switch off
so despite all this did the critics have any views on who would winclint eastwoods million dollar baby affected people emotionally which is why it will beat aviator which was about technical artistry not feelings mr karger said
eastwood has it in the bag added mr strauss
oscar voters often vote with their hearts not their heads and mr goodridge said best film and director were between martin scorseses aviator and million dollar baby
mr karger whose favourite film of the year was mike leighs abortion drama vera drake stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments
i hope this is the year for small films to triumph he said
after all its still one of the biggest tv events of the year
martin scorseses the aviator will win best film at the oscars according to the uks leading movie critics
but several of those surveyed by the bbc news website think the veteran filmmaker will lose the best director prize to clint eastwood
most of the critics tipped jamie foxx and hilary swank to scoop best actor and actress for ray and million dollar baby respectively
the jury comprised experts and critics from the top uk film publications
the panel also revealed which nominees they would personally prefer to win
all expect the aviator to win best film but many think it will be a close race between scorseses howard hughes biopic and eastwoods boxing drama million dollar baby
the other films nominated are wine comedy sideways factual drama finding neverland and ray charles biopic ray
im pretty sure this is the year of the aviator though my own choice would be sideways said the observers philip french
sideways should win but it doesnt have a hope said jamie graham of total film a position shared by film 2005 presenter jonathan ross
the form going in to the oscars points to the aviator but i liked million dollar baby more said tim dams news editor of trade weekly screen international
five of the eight critics tipped scorsese to win best director with mr dams heats charles gant and empires angie errigo plumping for eastwood
sideways alexander payne rays taylor hackford and british director mike leigh  nominated for period drama vera drake  are considered outsiders in this category
up until recently i could have sworn scorsese would get it just for being scorsese ms errigo told the bbc news website
but im beginning to think eastwood will get itid be very happy for mike leigh to win but i dont think he has any chance said charles gant film editor of heat
foxxs portrayal of ray charles has already seen him win prizes at the golden globes baftas and screen actors guild awards
mr dams said this made him outandout favourite to be named best actor on oscar night
everyone would be incredibly surprised if he didnt win he said
if youre a betting man hes as close as you get to a certainty if paul giamatti was nominated for sideways it would be a different game says total films jamie graham
but foxx will and should winwith vera drake star imelda staunton nominated for best actress alongside kate winslet britain has a good chance of victory  on paper
jonathan ross for one will be very happy if winslet wins for eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
but while wendy ide of the times still thinks staunton has a chance heats charles gant believes her bafta win will cut little ice with academy voters
id like staunton to win but her chances are not that great said mr gant who predicted a second oscar for hilary swank
i think swank will win said mr french
imelda has got as far as shes going to get playing that role staunton is also the personal choice of steven gaydos executive editor of industry magazine variety
but while he tipped swank to win he predicted it would be a close contest
everything has the ability to flip by one vote and go the other way he told the bbc news website
theres not a sense that its obvious how its going to go meanwhile thousands of people have voted in a bbc radio five live poll to find the best film never to have won a best picture oscar
the audience voted overwhelmingly for the shawshank redemption the 1994 frank darabont tale of hope and humanity which received 52 of the online votes and 68 of the text messages
the other two finalists citizen kane and a matter of life and death split the remaining votes roughly equally

three of the five nominees in the liveaction short film category at this years oscars were british
for andrea arnold who won the category ashvin kumar and gary mckendry the past month has thrust them from relative obscurity into the limelight
arnolds gritty drama wasp is about a single mother living on the breadline while kumars little terrorist follows a young pakistani muslim boy who gets stuck on the wrong side of the heavily armed indian border
mckendrys entry everything in this country must forces british soldiers and catholics to challenge their relationship during the troubles in northern ireland
last week the trio attended an official screening of all the nominated short films at the academys headquarters in beverly hills
i felt so privileged to have a thousand people watching my film on the biggest screen ive ever seen says arnold
set in her native dartford wasp tells the story of a young mum who unable to find a babysitter leaves her four young daughters outside a pub while shes on a date
the image that sparked the film was that of a wasp crawling into a babys mouth
the other nominees said they made their films for this reason or that  they had something to say
but i just start with an image i cant shake off work outwards from that and see what comes out she explains
since she presented childrens tv shows number 73 and motormouth in the 1980s arnold has kept a low profile and is having trouble adapting to this sudden onslaught of attention
im not interested in the publicity
its not my personality
im overwhelmed by all the fuss she said
its all a bit like a beauty contest  all the films are great and so different
but even though my film has won 30 awards worldwide including one at sundance last month id still be proud of it  even if it hadnt won any asked what the nomination means to her arnold says she feels flattered and honoured
weve all been overwhelmed by the response and cant get it in perspective yet
im still reelingand she wont commit to an opinion of hollywood yet
im just in the middle of it living moment to moment day to day but despite her reservations about the academy awards and the media frenzy that surrounds it she accepts that it has opened doors for her
people will definitely listen to what i want to do now and the phone didnt stop ringing for a week after i got nominated as for the future arnold firmly believes that you often get a stronger vision of the world with short films
youre left more to your own devices without people interfering as much that said she is currently working on a feature film with dogville and dancer in the dark director lars von trier

a pr expert has told the michael jackson child abuse trial that the tv documentary at the heart of the case was an absolute disaster
ann kite told the court in the californian town of santa maria she was hired to crisis manage the fallout after the programme had aired in 2003
jurors saw the film in which the pop star held hands with the alleged victim on tuesday
mr jackson denies 10 charges of child abuse and false imprisonment
if convicted he could face up to 21 years in prison
ms kite suggested jacksons associates had been intent on launching a smear campaign against the accusers family after the airing of martin bashirs film living with michael jackson
she told the court that in the aftermath of the broadcast a jackson lawyer had told her the boys mother would be made to look like a crack whore
jacksons defence questioned ms kites credibility pointing that she worked for the singers team for less than a week before being fired and had never met or spoken to the star
ms kite said she received a phone call on 13 february 2003 from a jackson associate marc schaffel who said the boy and his family had left the neverland ranch where they had been staying
ms kite told the court she had later asked jacksons lawyer david legrand what had happened
i said dont make me believe that these people were hunted down like dogs and brought back to the ranch she said
ms kite began to work for mr jackson in february 2003 after the controversial film was televised in the us and europe
the documentary sparked a media storm and the subsequent investigation into mr jacksons relationship with the boy
in the film the singer said he did not see anything wrong with sharing a bed with a child
questioned by the prosecution ms kite said her plan had been to move media coverage of the star away from a focus on his human frailties to concentrate more on his musical genius
ms kite said that an additional problem was the release of documents relating to a previous allegation of child abuse against mr jackson
the smoking gun website publication was beyond disaster ms kite said
correspondents say the reference is important because it was unclear whether the prosecution would be able to bring up the previous case in front of the jury
the judge is studying whether the prosecutions first witness reporter martin bashir is in contempt of court
the defence protested after mr bashir who interviewed jackson for the tv documentary refused to answer nearly all their questions citing a california shield law intended to allow journalists to protect their sources
in the prosecutions opening statement on monday tom sneddon told the court that mr jackson had shown the boy porn and plied him with wine in order to molest him
he said the singer had visited sexually explicit websites and showed the boy  who was 13 at the time  and his younger brother pornography at his ranch

french booksellers are braced for a rush of interest after another book from the author of the da vinci code is translated into french
angels and demons by us author dan brown will go on sale on wednesday
the da vinci code is set in paris  including the louvre  and has sold around one million copies in france
the main character robert langdon also appears in angels and demons
the da vinci code is being made into a film starring tom hanks
angels and demons was written before the da vinci code which has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide and been translated into more than 40 languages since it was released in 2003
angels and demons is set mainly in rome as symbologist robert langdon follows a 400yearold trail to try to uncover a plot by an ancient brotherhood the illuminati to blow up the vatican
the novel deals with moral issues such as the debate between science and religion and also seeks to uncover some of the mysteries surrounding the pope
on his website brown wrote i think the reason angels and demons is raising eyebrows right now is that it opens some vatican closets most people dont even know exist
but i think most people understand that an organisation as old and powerful as the vatican could not possibly have risen to power without acquiring a few skeletons in their closets such is the success of the da vinci code in france special tours have been organised to trace langdons footsteps including the the louvre museum and the saint sulpice church
the louvre has also given permission for parts of the film version to be shot in the museum
the film to be directed by a beautiful minds ron howard is due to start filming at the paris museum in may and stars hanks alongside french actress audrey tautou
