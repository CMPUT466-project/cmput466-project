the ds spearheads nintendos attempt to continue its dominance of the handheld gaming market
since going on sale in japan and the us at the end of 2004 nintendo has sold almost 4m ds consoles
part of this popularity may be due to the fact that the ds can run any of the catalogue of 700 games produced for nintendos gameboy advance handheld

about 130 games for the ds are in development
as well as having two screens one of which is controlled by touch the ds also lets players take on up to 16 other people via wireless

other ds owners can also be sent text messages and drawings
nintendo is also planning to release a media adapter for the handheld so it can play music and video
five virgin megastores and 150 game shops were expected to open early on friday morning to let people buy a ds
we know that customers want it as soon as its released  and that means the minute not the day said robert quinn games uk sales director
but nintendo will only have sole control of europes handheld gaming market for a few weeks because soon sony is expected to release its psp console
although nintendo is aiming for younger players and the psp is more for older gamers it is likely that the two firms will be competing for many of the same customers
sonys psp represents a real threat to nintendo because of the huge number of playstation owners around the world and the greater flexibility of the sleek black gadget
the psp uses small discs for games can play music and movies without the need for addons and also supports shortrange wireless play
when it goes on sale the psp is likely to cost between £130 and £200
