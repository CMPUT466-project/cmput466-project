the proportion of surfers using microsofts internet explorer ie has dropped to below 90 say web analysts
net traffic monitor onestatcom has reported that the opensource browser firefox 10 released on 9 november seems to be drawing users away from ie
while ies market share has dropped 5 since may to 889 mozilla browsers  including firefox  have grown by 5
firefox is made by the mozilla foundation which was set up by former browser maker netscape in 1998
although there have been other preview versions of firefox version 10 was the first complete official program
it seems that people are switching from microsofts internet explorer to mozillas new firefox browser said niels brinkman cofounder of amsterdambased onestatcom
mozilla browsers  including firefox 10  now have 74 of the market share the figures suggest
mozilla said that more than five million have downloaded the free software since its official release
supporters of the opensource software in the us managed to raise 250000 Â£133000 to advertise the release of firefox 10 in the new york times and support the mozilla foundation
there was a flurry of downloads on its first day of release
the figures echo similar research from net analyst websidestory which suggested that ie had 929 of users in october compared to 955 in june
microsoft ie has dominated the browser market for some time after taking the crown from netscape and its share of users has always stayed at around the 95 mark
firefox is attractive to many because it is opensource
that means people are free to adapt the softwares core code to create other innovative features like addons or extensions to the program
fewer security holes have also been discovered so far in firefox than in ie
paul randle microsoft windows client product manager responded to the figures we certainly respect that some customers will choose alternative browsers and that choosing a browser is about more than a handful of features
microsoft continues to make significant investments in ie including service pack 2 with advanced security technologies and continues to encourage a vibrant ecosystem of third party addons for internet explorer firefox wants to capture 10 of the market by the end of 2005
other browser software like opera and apples safari are also challenging microsofts grip on the browser market
opera is set to release its version 760 by the end of the year
