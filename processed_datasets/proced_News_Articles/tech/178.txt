sony playstation 2s slimmer shape has proved popular with uk gamers with 50000 sold in its first week on sale
sales have tripled since launch outstripping microsofts xbox said market analysts charttrack
the numbers were also boosted by the release of the ps2only game grand theft auto san andreas
the title broke the uk sales record for video games in its first weekend of release
latest figures suggest it has sold more than 677000 copies
it is obviously very very encouraging for sony because microsoft briefly outsold them last week john houlihan editor of computerandvideogamescom told bbc news
and with halo 2 for xbox out next week it really is a headtohead contest between them and xboxalthough xbox sales over the last week also climbed ps2 sales were more than double that
the figures mean sony is reaching the seven million barrier for uk sales of the console
edinburghbased developer rockstar which is behind the gta titles has seen san andreas pull in an estimated £24m in gross revenues over the weekend
in comparison blockbuster films like harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban took £115m in its first three days at the uk box office
the lord of the rings the return of the king took nearly £10m over its opening weekend although games titles are four to five times more expensive than cinema tickets
gangsterthemed gta san andreas is the sequel to grand theft auto vice city which previously held the record for the fastestselling video game ever
the xbox game halo 2 released on 11 november in the uk is also widely tipped to be one of the bestselling games of the year
the original title won universal acclaim in 2001 and sold more than four million copies
mr houlihan added that sony had done well with the ps2 but it definitely helped that the release of san andreas coincided with the slimline ps2 hitting the shelves
the runup to christmas is a huge battlefield for games consoles and titles
microsofts xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales
the sales figures also suggest that it may be a largely adult audience driving demand since gta san andreas has an 18 certificate
sony and microsoft have both reduced console prices recently and are preparing the way for the launches of their next generation consoles in 2005
both have hit crucial price points at around £100 and that really does open up new consoles to new audience plus the release of two really important games in terms of development are also driving those sales said mr houlihan
