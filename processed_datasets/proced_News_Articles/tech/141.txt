the us has pushed japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with ibms prototype blue genel machine
it is being assembled for the lawrence livermore national laboratory under the us department of energy
ibm test results show that blue genel has managed speeds of 7072 teraflops
the previous top machine japans nec earth simulator clocked up 3586
the top 500 list was announced on monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world
it is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called linpack which measures calculations per second
once completed in 2005 blue genel will be more powerful than its current prototype
next year with the final blue gene four times what it is this year it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat said erich strohmaier one of the cofounders of the top500 list
it will help scientists work out the safety security and reliability requirements for the uss nuclear weapons stockpile without the need for underground nuclear testing
it will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power a big problem for supercomputers
in second place was silicon graphics columbia supercomputer based at the us space agencys nasa ames research center in california
the linuxbased machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 427 trillion calculations per second teraflops in october
it will be used to model flight missions climate research and aerospace engineering
the defeated japanese contender the earth simulator which was listed in third place losing the top spot it had held since june 2002
it is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity
since the first supercomputer the cray1 was installed at los alamos national laboratory us in 1976 computational speed has leaped 500000 times
the cray1 was capable of 80 megaflops 80 million operations a second
the blue genel machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster
started in 1993 the top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world
it is presented at the international supercomputer conference in pittsburgh
