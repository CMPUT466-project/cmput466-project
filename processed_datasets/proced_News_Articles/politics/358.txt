britains Â£3bn eu rebate is not up for renegotiation at next weeks european council summit jack straw said
the foreign secretary told mps the rebate secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 was entirely justified
new european commission president jose manuel barroso has suggested the cash could be shared out among net contributors to the eu budget
mr straw acknowledged some countries in the newly enlarged 25 nation eu still had to see the light on the rebate
but the foreign secretary told the commons foreign affairs committee our position is very clear it is entirely justified and it is not for negotiation he added that he did not think there would be a political price to pay for the uks stance  britain contributed more and received less than other eu states
the twoday european council summit in brussels begins on 16 december and is widely expected to mark the beginning of a lengthy negotiating period over the eus budget for 200713
the wrangling could stretch into 2005 even 2006
the uk france germany austria the netherlands and sweden want the eu budget to be capped at 1 of member states combined national incomes  the commission wants it to be 126
mr straw said the eu commissions proposal would mean a 35 hike in the budget
i dont know of any national government thinking of increasing its budget by that amount he added
the foreign secretary said he hoped the talks next week could produce a date in 2005 for the beginning of negotiations with turkey about possible eu membership although that there would be no prospect of a date for joining for some time
