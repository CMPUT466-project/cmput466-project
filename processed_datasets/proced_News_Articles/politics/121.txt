hospital waiting times for patients in wales are to be cut but not to the same extent as those in england
welsh health minister jane hutt said no patient would wait more than 12 months for an outpatient appointment by march 2006 against a current target of 18 months
but she said the target for an inpatient appointment would remain at 12 months for march 2006
the announcement came as new monthly waiting figures showed a drop
this current inpatient target was set when the assembly government extended its second offer guarantee scheme which gives patients the option of having their treatment outside wales
details about funding to resource the new targets are expected in the new year
in england the current target for inpatients  seeing a consultant to having an operation  is six months
dr richard lewis welsh secretary of the british medical association bma welcomed the new targets to make further and faster progress on waiting lists
however much remains to be done on waiting lists and waiting times because wales still lags a long way behind england he said
capacity must be built into the system with sustained investment to ensure that welsh patients dont receive a worse service than patients over the border health analyst tony beddow from the welsh institute for health and social care called the new targets reasonably impressive
on wednesday ms hutt also announced Â£264m for health services will be spent reducing waiting times improving key areas and modernising staff pay structures in wales
ms hutt said major achievements had been made in cutting unacceptably long waits for treatment over the past year
we are turning the corner on long waits in wales
now we need to see those reductions in long waiters being improved again she said
she added the targets intended to ensure noone waits more than a year for treatment or to see a consultant
but let us not forget two thirds of those waiting for treatment now are waiting less than six months and these targets affect the small minority of patients in wales that are waiting far too long rhodri glyn thomas plaid cymru health spokesman said its exactly the same target she set in 1999 with the qualification that its dependent on a second offer
its a failed target from a failed ministerwith a failed policy for the welsh liberal democrats kirsty williams called the new target hugely unambitious
it leaves patients in wales still waiting two years before theyre treated conservative health spokesman jonathan morgan said were spending more money but waiting lists have gone through the roof
the audit commission has said that the money is not being spent efficiently or effectively and thats quite a criticism meanwhile the latest monthly waiting list figures showed the total number of people waiting more than 18 months as an inpatient in wales has fallen by 98
statistics to the end of november showed a decline since october from 785 to 708
the number waiting over 12 months also fell from 7613 to 6630 or 129
ms hutt said they were excellent figures
there are 305775 people on a waiting list of some kind down from 311764 last month
