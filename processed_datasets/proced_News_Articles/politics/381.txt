support for a ban on hunting has fallen in the past six years a poll suggests
less than half the uk wants a ban compared to almost twothirds in 1999 the mori survey of 2000 adults for bbc ones countryfile programme suggests
the number opposed to a ban remains constant but those neither supporting nor opposing has increased by 11
most citydwellers support the ban but rural people were evenly split between supporters opponents and undecided
polling company mori carried out both surveys
in july 1999 they asked 801 adults if they supported the ban for the mail on sunday
for countryfile they asked 2234 adults across the country the same question
the mail on sunday survey found that 63 supported a hunting ban compared with 24 against
in the countryfile survey 47 said they supported the legislation with 26 against
but the programme makers suggest the british public are becoming increasingly neutral to the issue because around one quarter said they neither support nor oppose a ban
