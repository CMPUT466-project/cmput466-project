spain coach luis aragones is furious after being fined by the spanish football federation for his comments about thierry henry
the 66yearold criticised his 3000 euros £2060 punishment even though it was far below the maximum penalty
i am not guilty nor do i accept being judged for actions against the image of the sport he said
im not a racist and ive never lacked sporting decorum
ive never done that and i have medals for sporting merit aragones was handed the fine on tuesday after making racist remarks about henry to arsenal teammate and spanish international jose reyes last october
the spanish football federation at first declined to take action against aragones but was then requested to do so by spains antiviolence commission
the fine was far less than the expected amount of about £22000 or even the suspension of his coaching licence
arsenal boss arsene wenger who was fined £15000 in december for accusing manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy of cheating believes that aragones punishment was too lenient
you compare his fine and my fine and if you consider his was for racist abuse then you seem to get away with it more in spain than you should wenger said
he shouldnt have said what he said and how much money is enough i dont know but it doesnt look a big punishment however aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair
i have been treated like islero the bull that killed famous bullfighter manolete said aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions
i have not liked one thing about this whole affair and i do not agree with the sanction
they have looked for a scapegoat spains antiviolence commission must now ratify the spanish fas decision and has until next week to announce its verdict
aragones has 10 days to appeal and the commission can also appeal
alberto flores president of the spanish fas disciplinary committee said noone in the committee felt aragones was a racist nor had acted in a racist way a fine the highest we could apply is sufficient punishment
suspension would have been a bit exaggerated flores told sports daily marca
