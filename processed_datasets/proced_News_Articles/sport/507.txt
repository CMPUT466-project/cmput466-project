topseeded americans andy roddick and andre agassi survived minor scares to reach the last eight of the sap open
agassi endured early problems against lefthanded dane kenneth carlsen before sealing a 75 61 victory
and world number three roddick dropped a set to korean player hyungtaik lee before pulling out a 63 36 62 win in san jose california
seventh seed jurgen melzer came through 63 63 against xavier malisse  winner in delray beach last week
frenchman cyril saulnier meanwhile fired 19 aces to secure a 61 76 win over czech qualifier tomas zib
roddick broke a racket in frustration in the third game of the second set
and afterwards was unimpressed with his form
im not playing great he said
but im through and im going to keep battling
a lot of people are under the assumption that its easy to play well every week and its not it is the 12th time in 13 appearances at the event that agassi now 34 has progressed to the quarterfinal stage
he came from 040 down in the opening game to hold serve and gradually wore carlsen down after attacking his backhand
agassi also employed several lobs and charged to the net to unsettle the 31yearold dane ranked 88th in the world
as the match went on i got real patient and waited for my opportunities and felt pretty good said agassi
