womens top seed lindsay davenport drew spanish veteran conchita martinez
henman came from two sets down to defeat saulnier in the first round of the french open last year so he knows he faces a tough test in melbourne
the seventh seed who has never gone beyond the quarterfinals in the years first major and is lined up to meet roddick in the last eight is looking forward to the match
hes tough player on any surface hes got a lot of ability he said
we had a really tight one in paris that went my way so im going to need to play well from the outset because hes a dangerous competitor switzerlands federer seeded one is the hot favourite having won three of the four grand slam titles in 2004
he has beaten santoro in five of their seven previous encounters but is taking nothing for granted
its a tricky match federer said
i played him at the us open and won quite comfortably then
but you never know if the rhythm is a bit off he can keep you guessing and make it difficult
the most important thing though is to get used to playing fiveset matches and winning them the 23yearold could meet fourtime champion andre agassi in the quarterfinals before meeting russian marat safin the player he beat in last years final

hewitt is hoping to become the first australian man to win the event since mark edmondson in 1976
the 23yearold has never been beyond round four in eight attempts at melbourne park but has at least secured the opposite half of the draw to federer who beat him in the australian open wimbledon and us open last year
