fifteenyearold donald youngs first appearance in an atp tennis tournament proved brief as the teenager went out in round one of the san jose open
young shot to the top of the junior world rankings when he won the boys singles at januarys australian open
but the wildcard entry was dispatched by fellow american robby ginepri in straight sets 62 62 in california
despite that he was happy with his tour debut
it was fun
i had my chances but they didnt come through he said
young who beat two players ranked in the top 200 when he was just 14 was only 21 down in the first set before losing 10 of the next 13 games
and ginepri  six years older than the youngest player to ever win a junior slam and top the global standings  admitted he was impressed
hes very talented said ginepri
hes got a long future ahead of him
being lefthanded he was very quick around the court
his serve is a little deceptive
he came into the net and volleyed better than i thought earlier south korean hyungtaik lee defeated american janmichael gambill 63 76 74
american kevin kim defeated jan hernych of the czech republic 75 63 canadian qualifier frank dancevic downed american jeff morrison 46 76 73 60 and denmarks kenneth carlsen beat irakli labadze of the republic of georgia 67 47 62 63
top seed andy roddick launches his defence of the title on wednesday against qualifier paul goldstein
second seed andre agassi opens his campaign on tuesday against wildcard bobby reynolds last years us collegiate champion
agassi has won the san jose five times but his run of three straight titles ended last year when he fell to mardy fish in the semifinals
fish went on to lose to roddick in the final
