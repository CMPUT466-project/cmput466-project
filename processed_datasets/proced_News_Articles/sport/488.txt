serena williams staged a remarkable recovery to beat lindsay davenport and win her second australian open title
the 2003 champion claimed her seventh grand slam title and her first since wimbledon in 2003 26 63 60
williams had looked close to quitting with a rib injury when she left the court for treatment after five games
she quickly dropped the first set but from 33 in the second found another gear as davenports game collapsed allowing williams to take the title
williams later explained her injury problem saying it was the result of lunging for a ball early in the first set
lindsay had me on the run out wide on my backhand and my back went but eventually i was able to come back thank goodness she said
davenport paid tribute to williams saying shes had a tough couple of years and shes come back like a championthe 23yearold former world number one was in desperate trouble in the early stages as the injury hampered her service action
davenport took advantage to race through the opening set and held six break points in game five of the second
i kept thinking to myself im not losing this game said williams afterwards
i dont care if my arm falls off im not losing this game
and i guess thats what happened
i didnt want to lose that particular game because it would have given her a lot of momentum and a lot of confidence despite letting the break points slip away davenport looked comfortable enough at 33 but from 400 up she just folded
williams won nine consecutive points for the set and powered through the decider as a lacklustre davenport looked to have run out of energy after a gruelling two weeks
i felt like i was playing well and in control pretty much of the match said davenport
then i just had that horrible lapse i think serving up 400 and made a few errors and opened up the door for her and she just kept going through it
at the end i think i was a little bit fatigued but she took advantage of it and kept going  shes a great frontrunner when she gets going
