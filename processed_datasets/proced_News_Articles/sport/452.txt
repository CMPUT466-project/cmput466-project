top seed guillermo coria went out of the heineken open in auckland on thursday with a surprise loss to olivier rochus of belgium
coria lost the semifinal 64 64 to rochus who goes on to face czech jan hernych a 64 75 winner over jose acasuso of argentina
fifth seed fernando gonzalez eased past american robby ginepri 63 64
the chilean will meet sixth seed juan ignacio chela next after the argentine beat potito starace 61 76 75
rochus made the semifinals at the australian hardcourt championships in adelaide last week and is naturally delighted with his form
its been two unbelievable weeks for me he said
today i knew i had nothing to lose
if i beat him great if i lost i would be losing to a top10 player coria conceded that rochus played just too good and added when you give your best out there you cant be too sad
