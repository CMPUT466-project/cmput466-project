newcastle boss graeme souness is lining up a summer move for england and real madrid striker michael owen
he sees owen as the ideal replacement for alan shearer who is due to retire in the summer although he hopes to persuade shearer to carry on
michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and were monitoring him he told bbc newcastle
he is a great centreforward and only 25 but i dont think were the only ones monitoring the situation at real souness has also hinted he thinks shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season
he believes the prospect of breaking jackie milburns club scoring record may influence the strikers decision
milburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957 while shearer currently has 187 goals to his name
without giving too much away i am confident he will be here next season said souness
i cant imagine him leaving without breaking jackie milburns scoring record souness also revealed he tried to bring back nolberto solano during the january transfer window
the peruvian international was sold to aston villa a year ago but in the phonein for bbc newcastle souness said tried to resign him but villa were not interested in selling
the former rangers and liverpool boss is also looking to bring in a number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed
im after three four or five new players in the summer  we have got lots of targets he said
dont think we will wait to the last day of the season to say who are we going to target now
