tim henman saved a match point before fighting back to defeat british rival greg rusedski 46 76 86 64 at the dubai tennis championships on tuesday
world number 46 rusedski broke in the ninth game to take a tight opening set
rusedski had match point at 65 in the second set tiebreak after henman doublefaulted but missed his chance and henman rallied to clinch the set
the british number one then showed his superior strength to take the decider and earn his sixth win over rusedski
serve was held by both players with few alarms until the seventh game of the final set when rusedskis wild volley gave henman a vital break
a furious rusedski slammed his racket onto the ground in disgust and was warned by the umpire
henman seeded three then held his serve comfortably thanks to four serveandvolley winners to take a clear 53 lead
rusedski won his service game but henman took the first of his three match points with a service winner to secure his place in the second round at dubai for the first time in three years
it was the first match between the pair for three years  henman last lost to rusedski six years ago  and lasted two hours and 40 minutes
the pair are now likely to only face each other on court as rivals  rather than as teammates  after henman decided to retire from davis cup tennis leaving rusedski to lead the team out against israel on 46 march
henman who now faces russian igor andreev in the last 16 admitted afterwards it was difficult coming up against his compatriot on a fast surface
you just take it point by point when youre fighting to stay in the match he said
i had to keep playing aggressively and competing to get a chance
i now have to recover in time for the next match because the body doesnt recover as quick as it used to especially after two hours and 40 minutes
