david beckham expressed his relief at real madrids passage to the champions league knockout phase
after reals 30 win at roma the england skipper admitted another season of underachievement would not be tolerated at the bernabeu stadium
beckham said its expected of madrid to get through but its a relief for the club and players to have won
we lost momentum last season but we cannot afford to to go another season without winning anything reals finish as runnersup in their champions league group means they cannot face his old club manchester united in the next round
but real could be drawn against other premiership hopefuls arsenal or chelsea who won their respective groups
its going to be great whoever we play even if we dont get either of the two english teams
