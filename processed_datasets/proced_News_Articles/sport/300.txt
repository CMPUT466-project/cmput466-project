bath prop duncan bell has been added to englands 30man squad to face ireland in the rbs six nations
and with phil vickery sidelined for at least six weeks with a broken arm and julian white out with a neck injury bell could make his england debut
bell 30 had set his sights on an international career with wales
but last december the international rugby board confirmed that he could only be eligible for england as he had travelled on tour with them in 1998
england coach andy robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced sale sharks prop andrew sheridan into his front row
but sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped bell  who was among the tryscorers when england a beat france a 3020 nine days ago  to be drafted in
robinson also has an injury worry over centre olly barkley who withdrew from baths starting lineup to face gloucester last weekend
he was due to have a hospital scan on monday while gloucester centre henry paul who started at flyhalf against bath limped out at kingsholm because of an ankle problem
despite barkleys three missed penalties in the 1817 defeat against france he is expected to retain his place at inside centre although leicesters inform prospect ollie smith would be an obvious replacement
bath coach john connolly rates barkley as no better than a 5050 chance to make the dublin trip
uncapped flyhalf andy goode has been named in a 30man training squad for the ireland game and he strengthened his selection claims by kicking 28 points during leicesters record 8310 win against newcastle on sunday
englands players are due to meet at their surrey training base on monday
