chelsea goalkeeper carlo cudicini will miss sundays carling cup final after the club dropped their appeal against his red card against newcastle
the italian was sent off for bringing down shola ameobi in the final minute of sundays match
blues boss jose mourinho had promised to pick cudicini for the final instead of firstchoice keeper petr cech
the 31yearold will now serve a onematch suspension commencing with immediate effect
cudicini kept a club record 24 clean sheets last season for chelsea but petr cech has established himself as first choice for mourinho since moving to stamford bridge in summer 2004
the 22yearold czech republic international has set a new premiership record of 961 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal a mark which is still running
but mourinho has used cudicini regularly in the carling cup and the italian has only let in one goal in his four appearances during chelseas run to the final
