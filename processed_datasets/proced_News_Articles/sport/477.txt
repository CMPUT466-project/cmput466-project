fifth seed carlos moya was the first big name to fall at the australian open as he went down to fellow spaniard guillermo garcialopez on monday
moya began the year with victory at the chennai open but looked out of sorts from the start in the melbourne heat
garcialopez ranked 106 in the world dominated from the outset and withstood a thirdset rally from moya to hang on for a 75 63 36 63 victory
the 21yearold plays kevin kim or lee hyuungtaik in the second round
garcialopez was delighted with the victory in only his third ever grand slam match
i think this was the most important win of my life as carlos is one of the best players in the world he said
this has given me a lot of confidence
now i feel i can beat all these players moya said i was playing well before i came here
it was the perfect preparation but something was wrong todayfourtime champion andre agassi began what could be his last australian open with a convincing win over german qualifier dieter kindlmann
the 34yearold american who had been struggling with a hip injury earlier in the week stormed to a 64 63 60 win
agassi will play frances olivier patience or germanys rainer schuettler  the man he beat in the 2003 final  in the next round
no one was more concerned about the injury than myself said eighth seed agassi
id worked hard to be down here and ready
but the last few days ive pushed through the injury and it seemed to do pretty good in other matches world junior champion gael monfils made use of his wild card with a magnificent 16 63 64 76 86 win over american robby ginepri
the 2002 champion thomas johansson fought back to beat peter luczak 76 75 46 63 46 60 and french open champion gaston gaudio beat justin gimelstob 76 73 64 63
seeds dominik hrbaty ivan ljubicic and mario ancic made comfortable progress but former french open champion albert costa lost to bjorn phau
