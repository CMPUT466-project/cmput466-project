fifth seed robin soderling took the milan indoors title with a dramatic win over radek stepanek in sundays final
the 20yearold swede edged the final set tiebreak for a 63 67 27 76 75 victory and his second tour title after winning in lyon last year
im delighted to have won against such a good opponent in a tournament of this importance said soderling
i was really on form my service was good and i really liked playing on the synthetic surface soderling the world number 37 shrugged off a nervous start to take the opening set on his first set point
a change in approach from fourth seed stepanek in the second set paid dividends as he took it on a tiebreak but soderlings superior power proved too much in the third
