the germanborn vaidisova rallied well at times but was unable to find a way back after falling behind 32 in the opening set
davenport who closed out with an ace plays karolina sprem in the next round
i was fully expecting a tough opponent and was able to play well enough to get through it said davenport
i think she hits some great shots
she made some errors but probably some inexperience played a role in that
but shes so young and obviously has a big game and has many many years to improve on that sprem the croatian 13th seed saw off russias elena likhovtseva 63 62
