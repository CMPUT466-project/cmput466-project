patrick kluiverts closerange finish put newcastle ahead after 31 minutes but they were pegged back as bramble headed in steven gerrards corner
neil mellor gave liverpool the lead before halftime from milan baros pass before the czech added a third after rounding shay given on the hour
newcastle then had lee bowyer sent off for two bookable offences
liverpool brought back luis garcia after a hamstring injury while newcastle were forced to draft in kluivert after craig bellamy was a late withdrawal with a back injury sustained in the warmup
and garcia should have crowned his return with a goal inside the opening minute when he took a pass from baros but shot wildly over the top from eight yards
olivier bernard was only inches away from giving newcastle the lead after 20 minutes when he fired just wide from a freekick 25 yards out
but sounesss side did go ahead 11 minutes later in highly controversial circumstances
kluivert looked suspiciously offside when kieron dyer set bowyer free but the dutchman was then perfectly placed to score from six yards
the lead lasted three minutes with liverpool back on terms as bramble headed gerrards corner into his own net under pressure from sami hyypia
and liverpool were ahead after 37 minutes when baros slid a perfect pass into mellors path for the youngster to slip a sliderule finish into givens bottom corner
garcias finishing was wayward and he was wasteful again in firsthalf injury time shooting tamely at given after good work by xabi alonso
any hopes of a newcastle recovery looked to be snuffed out on the hour when a brilliant turn and pass by harry kewell set baros free and he rounded given to score
jermaine jenas then missed a glorious chance to throw newcastle a lifeline shooting over from just eight yards out from shola ameobis cross
then bowyer who had already been booked for a foul on alonso was deservedly shown the red card by referee graham poll for a wild challenge on liverpool substitute florent sinamapongolle
