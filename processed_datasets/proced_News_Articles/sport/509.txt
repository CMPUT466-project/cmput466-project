i had a good game plan and i executed it perfectly he said
its always tough to come out to play andre
i didnt want him to play his game
he makes you run like a dog all over the court and agassi who was more than matched for power by his opponents twohanded backhand said melzer was an example of several players on the tour willing to take their chances against him
a lot more guys are capable of it now said the american
he played much better than me
thats what he did both times
i had opportunities to loosen myself up agassi added
but i didnt convert on the big points
