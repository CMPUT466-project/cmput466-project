this goes to the heart of the european project and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worriedbut small companies and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trademore directly once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone elses patentthey have legal departments and more crucially patents of their own which they can trade or crosslicense with other patent holdersa new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompsonthe same does not hold for a patentafter all how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computerimplemented inventions and the way it amends article 52 of the 1973 european patent conventionif the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source productsit is a small invention but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns itmuch of the really useful software we use every day programs like the apache web server the gnulinux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringementsthe new proposals go back to 2002 although argument about patentability of software and computerimplemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid1980sif it gets its way the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against themthe new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areasit will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors use of really obvious ideasthe proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies but this is hardly surprising since most of them are usbased and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patentsmany observers of the computing scene including myself think the results will be disastrous for small companies innovative programmers and the free and open source software movementif it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then i could defend myself in court by claiming that i had simply made it up and it was coincidencea patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention even if the other person invented it separately
