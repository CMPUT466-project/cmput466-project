when operators such as bt and telewest offered standard 512k broadband for less than £20 at the beginning of the year it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached  broadband had truly gone mass marketanother big piece of news for broadband users in 2004 was the extension of bts reach meaning more than 95 of the population could get broadband regardless of how far away from the exchange they livedby september the number of broadband connections in the uk finally overtook dialup and in december bt announced that it was making a new broadband connection every 10 secondsbroadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators ntl and telewest also had a bumper yearin may bt quietly announced that it was shaving 70 off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges socalled local loop unbundlingbroadband was being mentioned on the 10 oclock news and in the tabloids the sun even carried a cartoon joke about itwith cheaper local loop unbundling rivals to bt can offer faster services that will leave the broadband of today looking positively tortoiselikebroadband for less than £10 was even touted by some firms although such a low price raised eyebrows among more established companies questioning how they are able to sustain such business modelsthere was a slight caveat for those wanting to upgrade to 1mbps broadband they still have to live within six kilometres of a broadbandenabled exchangebut two of the most significant pieces of news for broadband were items that did not make the headlinesthis perhaps said more about how indispensable people were beginning to perceive the technology rather than how useful skyhigh broadband would actually bethe biggest news for them was increased speeds introducing 2mb and 3mb services for users and offering a free upgrade to those on 512kthe cable operators are limited in their reach and it is perhaps testament to how big a deal local loop unbundling could become that even they are considering extending their range via this route
