a major system has evidently collapsed and we need to know what went wrong and what is being done differentlythat means we need a full report on what went wrong and what was done to fix itso i will reserve judgment on the technology aspects until we all know what actually happened and whether it was a consequence of software failure or just bad lucka major government department is without email for a week and technology analyst bill thompson wants to know what happenedalthough the full story has not yet been told it seems that the problem started when a plan to upgrade some of the computers from windows 2000 to windows xp went wrong and xp code was inadvertently copied to thousands of machines across the networkif there had been an outbreak of legionnaires disease in the air conditioning system we would have been told but it seems that major technology problems do not merit the same treatmentsenior consultants from eds the computer firm which manage the system and microsoft which supplied the software were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all while staff resorted to phone fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work doneit is without a doubt a major story and was the second or third lead item on bbc radio 4s today programme throughout friday morningit is the network equivalent of godels theorem  any system sufficiently complex to be useful is also able to collapse catastrophicallywhy was not the pensions minister in parliament to make an emergency statement on tuesday when it was clear that there was a serious problemthis is certainly unfortunate but i have a lot of sympathy for the network managers and technology staff involved
