i have never really approved of using the internet protocol ip to do either audio or video streaming and i think that technically it is a disaster to make phone calls over the net using voice over ipwith vodafone now pushing its own 3g service and 3 already established in the uk video on the phone is clearly going to become a musthave for kids sitting on the school bus adults waiting outside clubs and anyone who has time to kill and a group of friends to impressi bought my son max a 3g phone partly because they are so cheap and he needed a phone and partly because i am supposed to know about the latest technology and thought i should see how they work in real lifebut we should not see these new phones simply as cutdown network terminalsbut just as the world wide web was the killer application that drove internet adoption music videos are going to drive 3g adoptionbut 3g networks have been designed to do this sort of streaming both for voice and video which gives them an edge over netbased ip services3g phones and ipods can coexist at least for a while but if i had to bet on the long term i would go for content on demand over carrying gigabytes in my pocketby contrast the confusing menus complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of maxs 3g phone simply get in the way and i did not see much value in the paidfor services especially the limited web accessif i want fast access to my email i can get a 3g card for my laptop or hook up to a wireless networkbut it goes deeper than that playing music videos on a phone marks the beginning of a move away from the download and play model we have all accepted for our ipods and mp3 playersi am even playing with internet telephony despite my reservations and i appear on go digital on the world service streamed over the web each weekthe 3g services arent quite there yet and there is a lot to be sorted out when it comes to web access and data chargesafter using it for a while i am not at all tempted to get rid of my sonyericsson p800 smart phonethe quality was at least as good as the video streaming from the bbc website and the image is about the same sizeit is certainly not a great overall experience but that is largely due to the poor menu system and the phone layout the video content itself is compelling
