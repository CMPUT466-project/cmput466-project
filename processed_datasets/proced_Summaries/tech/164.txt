but however careful you may be if the organisations you trust with your personal data bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in troublearmed with the personal details that a bank holds plus a fake letter or two it is apparently easy to get a loan open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone elses namefortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office plugging it into a usb slot and sucking down customer filesthe financial services authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer dataand just last week the online bank cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login nameafter all i bank with cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that i did not even consider it when i heard about their security problemsand as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account detailsthe real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net argues analyst bill thompsonthe fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society  our identitieswhether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job the issue is the same how do we make sure that our personal data is not abusedany organisation that processes personal data is of course bound by the data protection act and must take proper care of itthe two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity thefti doubt many others have closed their accounts especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in futurein fact i do not know of a single case where an email containing payment details has led to card fraud
