dr erel avineri of the centre for transport and society at the university of the west of england in bristol said the design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabledwhile toyotas prototypes are geared towards mass transport the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobilitythe personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilitiesthe concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions said dr gillingwaterwith an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population care giving and the military wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individuals particular mobility needsthe open leaflike iunit vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last yeara new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by japanese car giant toyotaboth these prototypes will be demonstrated along with other concept vehicles and helper robots at the toyota stand at the expo 2005 in aichi japan in march 2005they are clearly what we call concept vehicles innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production said dr david gillingwater from the transport studies group at loughborough universityyou have to ask whether these sorts of vehicles will appeal to these groupsthis and other humanfactors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered said dr avinerias always with these concept vehicles it is difficult to see who they would appeal to and what their role would be in the personal transport marketplaceit looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this needsuch singleperson vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transportthe companys vision for the single passenger in the 21st century involves the driver cruising by in a fourwheeled leaflike device or strolling along encased in an eggshaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet
