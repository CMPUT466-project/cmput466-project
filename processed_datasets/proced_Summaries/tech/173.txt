the us is poised to push japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with ibms prototype blue genel machinebut in september ibm said that another blue genel machine clocked up 3601 teraflops marginally surpassing the earth simulators performancedoe test results show that blue genel has managed speeds of 7072 teraflopsthe linuxbased machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 427 teraflops in octoberone area where mr donofrio sees supercomputing  and blue gene machines in particular  as crucial is healththe ibm blue genel is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version due to be completed for the livermore labs in 2005the blue genel machine that will be completed next year will be five million times fastercompared with the current fastest supercomputers blue gene is designed to consume one 15th the power and be 10 times more compactthe current top machine japans nec earth simulator clocks up 3586since the first supercomputer the cray1 was installed at los alamos national laboratory in 1976 computational speed has leaped 500000 timesdue next week the top 500 list officially charts the fastest computers in the worldhe believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century protein foldingthe us secretary of energy spencer abraham confirmed that the machine had reached the breakneck speed according to the linpack benchmarkthe cray1 was capable of 80 megaflops 80 million operations a secondibms senior vice president of technology and manufacturing nick donofrio believes that by 2006 blue gene will be capable of petaflop computingthis means it would be capable of doing 1000 trillion operations a second
