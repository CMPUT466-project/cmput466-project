the cell technology on the other hand uses multiple cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneouslyif cell succeeds in becoming the living room technology of choice however it could provide the jumpstart to the fully digital home of the futureby creating a radically new architecture and using that architecture in a games console that is sure to be a huge seller they hope that the cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room shutting out their rivalsthe speed of computer memory has been slowly increasing over the last few years but the memory technology that accompanies the cell is a huge leap in performancethe links between the multiple processors can also be extended to reach cell processors in entirely different systemsthe world is casting its gaze on the cell processor for the first time but what is so important about it and why is it so differentintel will be furiously working on new designs that address the problems of its current chips to create a rival technology to cell so that it doesnt lose its desktop pc dominancethe technology inside the cell is being heralded as revolutionary from a technical standpointthis digital home of the future depends on the widespread adoption of the cell processor and there are as with all things a number of reasons it could failsony will be using the chip inside its playstation 3 console and its dominance of the games market means that it now has a lot of power to dictate the future of computer and gaming platformstraditional computers  whether they are household pcs or playstation 2s  use a single processor to carry out the calculations that run the computereach cell will be linked to the others creating a vast home network of computing poweryou can also guarantee that microsoft and intel are not going to sit around and let cell take over home computing without a fight
