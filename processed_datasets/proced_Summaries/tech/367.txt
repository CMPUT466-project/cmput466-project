also said mr trainor research is being done on ways to cut energy consumption on displays  currently the biggest power guzzler on a laptopintel has been working with component makers to test energy consumption on all the parts inside a laptop and find ways to make them less power hungryon a larger scale said mr trainor improvements in the way that voltage regulators are made can reduce the amount of power lost as heat and make a notebook more energy efficientsome new battery chemistries promise to cram more power into the same space said mr trainor though work still needed to be done to get them successfully from the lab to manufacturingthe changes include everything from the way chips for laptops are made to tricks that reduce the power consumption of displayssome of the improvements in power use come simply because components on chips are shrinking said mr trainorit was not just a case of improving battery life by squeezing more out of the lithium ion power packs he explainedintel has also changed the way it creates transistors on silicon to reduce the power they needhe was sceptical that fuel cells would develop quick enough to take over from solid batteries even though they have the potential to produce several times more energy than lithium ion power packsthis work has led to the creation of the mobile pc extended battery life ebl working group that shares information about building notebooks that are more parsimonious with power
