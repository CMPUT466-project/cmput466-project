so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data said mr seagravemany of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting said mr kingits about understanding whats genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site she saidmalcolm seagrave security expert at energis said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of timeonce an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay upbigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen he saidmaria capella spokeswoman for net provider pipex said that when ddos attacks were at their height customers were getting hit every four to five dayswe have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together said mr seagravemr king said the only way to properly combat these socalled distributed denialofservice attacks was with intelligent netbased systemsthe serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom email said ms capellawe study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile thats when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack said ms capellayou can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites trying one after another said mr seagravethis traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data floodalso net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from
