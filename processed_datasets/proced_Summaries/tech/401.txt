he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour wasnt that unusual lots of people i knew in the game played eq that muchi think im obsessed with gaming in general i spend far too much time playing games like everquest 2 and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to im always thinking in the back if my mind that id rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge unitedi think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distincthe quit the game he says because he realised life was more fun than everquesthaving played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life suckingi spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning
 as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negativelythis game dominated 2 years of my life24hours when i was a kid at school and i was on half term ultima online was the game ahhhh them was the days the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft gameonline role playing games are timeconsuming but enthralling flights from realitysome of the comments were humorous this game is so good im not going to get it theres no way i could limit the hours id spend playing it wrote charles macintyre from englandi play games a lot definately over 20 hours a week but i dont go missing work or other commitments in order to play gameswhen you stop playing youre at the same point as when you started all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and since youve gained nothing in the real world you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake onehowever stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequentthe people who tend to hark on about about the problems of hardcore gaming seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a gamebut some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game mmorpg you need to get out more could be the motto of any mmorpgit is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times  in other words the goal offered in the pc game are easier and more fun than the real worldits getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming and enjoying real lifean addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair  keep track of time wrote travis anderson in texaswhilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tvgreat gamecan you reccomend a counsellor  this is not a wind up
but something im increasingly concerned with
 me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day were both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv trying to frag some individuali am obsessed with online role playing gamesmassively multiplayer online role playing games  mmorpgs  allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worldsobviously somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problemsadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming i find myself longing to have the time to join themmost mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children intoe hayot writing in the culture blogzine print culture said recently i used to play the online roleplaying game everquest a loti have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years  since that began games have become more and more complexthe longest i played was a 24 hour straight sessioni know of people who are spending their weeks holiday from work playing warcraftit came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real oneonline gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of othersin a game where you will never complete an ultimate goal well it would be like falling into a black pita few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday
 championship manager consumed my life for yearswhen i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so im trying not to spend so much time on therei have about a year ago deleted every game on my computerseven years ago i began playing ultima onlinewhen video game world of warcraft hit the shops in europe last week fans wrote in to the bbc website to express their delight  and to offer a warningi gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive but have subsequently just bought the european version couldnt help myselfan 11 hour stretch isnt that surprising  ive known people to play 15 hours at a stretchi wish 3040 hours a week was unusual but i think it probably isntgaming is like any other pastime  it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession whether it is spending too much time in the gym in front of the television or reading poetryonline gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television or going to the cinema or the pub with your matesbut the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too farthe scope of these games  like warcraft everquest ultima among others  is epic and exploration and adventure is almost infinitewhen i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year building up my stats completing evermore quests and battling ogresnearly most of south koreans are addicted to online games and one korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online gamesyou lie you dont go into work because you had stuff to do at home you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner you spend much less time watching tv a good thing presumably he wrote explaining how everquest took over his timefurthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect whereas other games and some other pursuits such as being a couch potato the players could be indulging in are solitary by natureanother correspondent wrote i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming and that is the cause of his depression and restlessnessfrom morning till the early hours of the next day the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain i would hardly eat perhaps some toast smoke endlessly and drinkdespite having little monetary value the rewards and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours dailythe problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming but with the nature of modern 24 hour cultureunfortunately gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to makei am actually convinced at this point that there are more than some people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality she saidscaremongering articles about addictive video games have existed since the days the first game of pong stopped everyone from working at the atari officeswhen i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from 730am till 5pmand more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them with and marriage and work being the main drag on my timethey are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly but this progress becomes exponentially slower requiring more and more time to reach the next level
