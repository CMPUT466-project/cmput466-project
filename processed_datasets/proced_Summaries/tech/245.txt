recent bond games like nightfire and everything or nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair invention and glamour of the film franchisethis title lacks that aura and when the bond magic shines through it feels like a lucky accidentthe notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a 007 game but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs towhat the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy dynamic scenes of violent chaosrogue agent signals its intentions by featuring james bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments squashed by a plummeting helicopterit is perhaps indicative of a lack of confidence that the game makers allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights  no time is risked with a measured buildupthe game is weak not completely unplayableadopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the originals massive sense of fungoldeneye rogue agent is out nowby far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like dr no goldfinger hatfiend oddjob and crazed russian sex beast xenia onatopp resurrected after all these years and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashiondiehard fans of bond will probably find enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failingsfor gaming fans the word goldeneye evokes excited memories not only of the james bond revival flick of 1995 but also the classic shootemup that accompanied it and left n64 owners glued to their consoles for many an hour
