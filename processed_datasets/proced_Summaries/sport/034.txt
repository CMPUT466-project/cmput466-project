and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan outdropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10000m five days later was not wiseit was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens storyone of my favourite olympic moments was kellys success in the 800mwinning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formalityso to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something specialthe victory for the british mens 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the gamesthat was her heart and not her head reactinghe was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5000m titlesand one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistleit was also a real delight for all athletics fans because to use one of my favourite words paula showed real bouncebackabilitythe thing is if we dont have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesnt look good for the beijing olympics and beyondwhat happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as wellthe only individual mens finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500mdani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gbpaula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the daythe lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stakewell its goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athensand thats where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy
