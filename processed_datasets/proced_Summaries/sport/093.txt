jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his backwithin three days he was arriving back in ireland by air ambulancebut when i got to the mater in dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to mei was in a lot of pain and i guessed that one of my toes was broken says the waterford manin my back it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but i was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully id be able to racemy back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae the bottom part had exploded so im fierce lucky not be paralysedbut training is just part of the process of getting backjamie didnt finally arrive at hospital in athens until some nine and a half hours after the accidentits all about trying to get mobility in my backhe says so himself in a matteroffact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the olympic stadium in athens for the 50k walkdoctors in athens had wanted to operate on jamies back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home  something he is now very relieved abouthopefully after four or five months my back wont tighten up as muchim doing about six hours a day between physio and pool workhe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 januarythat would have fused all my lower back and i would never have been able to race againid fractured my big toe as well which was on the brakeall these sessions are small steps on the way to what jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006
