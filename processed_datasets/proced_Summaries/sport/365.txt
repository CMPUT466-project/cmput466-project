but williams said i want to make it clear that im committed totally to scottish rugbyid like to stress that the national team is separate to the political situation he saidthere was some very unhelpful and uninformed comment that the national team had received a massive increase in budget at the expense of other parts of scottish rugby and that is simply not the casematt williams insists he has no thoughts of quitting as national coach as a result of the power struggle currently gripping scottish rugbythat means they will have 91 days away from their club from july until the six nationswe also attracted criticism because of the number of days players spent with the national teamthe idea that we are lighting cigars with Â£20 notes while the rest of scottish rugby flounders is absolutely untruethere must be a winwin philosophy and attitude within scottish rugby and that is what we are after  both groups winning not competing
