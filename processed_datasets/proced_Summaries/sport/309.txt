it was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board earlyevery one was a little down after the game following the injuries to brian and gordonit was great work by brian and i always knew i had scored even though it went upstairs to the video refereethe different interpretations between the referee and the players was a little difficultit was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove itit was very physical and fair play to the italians they made us work very hard for our victorytheir organisation was very very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go bythat new ruck law made it a bit more difficult to get out of our own halfi was very impressed the way the scots played against the french on saturdayeddie osullivan was very calm at halftime even though we were only 86 aheadso really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball
