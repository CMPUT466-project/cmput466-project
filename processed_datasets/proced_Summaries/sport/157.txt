arsenal keeper jens lehmann whose personal rivalry with bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn was not helped by the result said do i blame myself for the third goalkolo toures late goal gives the gunners hope for the second leg but wenger said the only positive is that we are still in the tieit would have been impossible to go through at 30  but with the goal we have chancesmy players failed to try and score a fourth to kill the tie and then conceded the late goali just know the goals were very easy against usarsenal are fully capable of scoring several goals against us on their own turfin my time here we have never conceded three easy goals like that  but sometimes it happensgoalscorer toure was also at fault for two goals and wenger said we need to help toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment
