yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birminghamfrom an international perspective i thought meseret defar was disappointing in the 3000m but i dont think the pacemaking was greatworld records aside i thought it was a very encouraging evenings work for kelly holmesshe had a go but just could not hang in therefrom a british point of view sarah claxtons victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meetshe looked good and was very positivebut he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and i still think he is in great shapeapparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and i would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a timeyes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last 200m as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is a bit of a benchmark for kellycanadian heather hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last years shape she would have given defar a real run for her moneyathletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and i would like to see her have a go at 5m in competitionhe was blatantly playing the falsestart game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look a bit sillyas for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti
