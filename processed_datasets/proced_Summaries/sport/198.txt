but edu was highly critical of the ferocity of some of uniteds challenges during the game particularly on jose antonio reyeshowever edu tried to play down the incidents adding there was nothing that i havent seen in brazilian derbiesthe brazilian confirmed tempers had flared but could shed no light on reports that food was thrown at united boss sir alex fergusonreyes was being kicked all over the park  they were beating up the boy and gary neville was tackling in such a way that he should have been sent offi like to play in games like this with this intense rivalry
