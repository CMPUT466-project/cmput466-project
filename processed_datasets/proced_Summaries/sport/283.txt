its a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goalit was a very nice goal it was clearly over the line  ive never seen one so over the line and not given in my careerspurs boss martin jol said his team were robbed at manchester united after pedro mendes shot clearly crossed the line but was not givenwhat i was against originally was the time factor in video replaysmendes could not believe the goal was not given after seeing a replayjol added we are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line it was a metre inside the goalwhen the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at old trafford that just reinforces what i feel  there should be video evidence said wengerbut i read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee cant make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry onbut at the end of the day its so obvious that pedros shot was over the line its incrediblehe said my reaction on the pitch was to celebratewhat really annoys me is that we are here in 2005 watching something on a tv monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isnt told about it
