agassi was delighted with victory over massu in his first match for over two monthsi liked the way the match played out and maybe excluding a few second serve returns i felt like i was doing most things pretty darn well for the first matchim not the most flexible and at the end of the year i was pretty exhausted and wanted to have a couple of weeks where i didnt do anything said henmanhenman made an impressive start to the year only faltering against nalbandian when serving for the match at 54its a great start to the year  just what i was looking for henman told his websitenow i have a day off and hopefully play better the next matchall in all im happy with the match and i won it  thats a good signbut the briton regained his composure to win the next two games for only his second win in six matches against the argentineit was about getting used to the surface he said
