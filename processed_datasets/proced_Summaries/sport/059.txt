diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarahbut what was great about sundays performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it countedthe event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition i think that would help hera lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that is a good performanceit was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking aroundthe best performance on the track for me was sarah claxtons win in the 60m hurdleshe feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him  but then phillips always hasin the womens race jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduakain the mens race on saturday allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from himshe picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and 60m hurdles and you cant ask for more than thatfindlay is a londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britaini had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out therewell i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospectsi chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an offday for him
