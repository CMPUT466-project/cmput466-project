mr forsyth links islamic fundamentalism to the new threatthe people who mr forsyth labels the new threat are those who do not follow the correct teachings of islammr forsyth has forgotten one key point the terrorists who threaten britain today are well aware that hitler stalin and the ira all failedthe british government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisationthe perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the alleged terrorists are doing but from our own governmentlike many of your respondents i wouldnt usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose views i share but in the instance of opposing charles clarks proposals for house arrest i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth  i agree with mr forsyththe british government is not going down the road that mr forsyth suggestsi agree wholeheartedly with mr forsythsadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the british people who have lived in a democracy protected by tony blair and others of like mind who mr
forsyth seems to be putting along side the scruffy little austriani do not usually agree with mr
forsyth but he is spot on herean interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat 1 if these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they will use them without fear of mutually assured destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balancethe threat now is newi agree with frederick forsythas it stands terrorists do not need to attack the uk
its government will soon have its people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombsi agree in many ways with what mr forsyth has said  if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk  how can we accuse countries such as zimbabwe and burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent it is hypocrisy of the highest ordermr forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinionsthe lord chancellor has defended government plans to introduce control orders to keep foreign and british terrorist suspects under house arrest where there isnt enough evidence to put them on trialif the government has its way with id cards tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or notpeople like forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite new labour and tony blairi agree the government is probably encouraging a degree of masshysteria and talking up the threat but talkingdown the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable toowe have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threati absolutely agree with frederick forsythalthough in principle i agree with him frederick forsyth fails to address one key point alqaeda attacks though obviously there have been none yet in the uk seek to kill the maximum number of peopleyes there has been oppression by the british government in the past and overstepping the mark in places like ireland but yes we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without chargetrial etcin this overly politically correct society it is good to see someone like mr
forsyth speak outmr forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation but could not verbaliseill bet any money you like that the day after any such attack freddie forsyth will be saying that the government didnt do enough to protect the uki am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that british people have enjoyed for centuries  the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open courtit is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end and terrorists can come in all forms as mr
forsythes opening comments suggestthe very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live is under attack not from terrorists but from this governmentthis government with much fanfare signs us up to the european convention on human rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trialto be protected from terror the government says we must become a tyranny2 the terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the london underground and we could do very little to stop itthe threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technologywhat is really worrying is the enthusiasm of mr blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fearthe problem i see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family only to people they dont like or are scared ofi agree with mr forsyths viewsi accept that the intentions of these policies are to make britain a safer place but i cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference  in northern ireland internment certainly didnt achieve anything  the bombings didnt stop and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the ira with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the britishthe nature of the current threat is newbut in the 66 years that i have been alive there has not been one hour of one day of one month of one year when there has not been a threat aimed at usyes i agree with mr
forsyths viewsbut to meet the new threat to defeat the sinister fanaticism of todays terrorists we may need to do things a little differentlyof course frederick is wrong about britain winning the war against the ira and hes wrong too about the country not becoming a tyrannybeing eight years older than frederick forsyth and a survivor of the blitz on london it is easy to agree with him he is absolutely spot onthey were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attackit will be a little late in the day when people outside london wake up one morning to find out that london has been nukedforsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism 3000 people died in one morning in ny on september 11th 2001but that is what the blair government now seeks to do  create a tyranny to defend us from the alqaeda tyrannyi never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by frederick forsyth but im in wholehearted agreement with him on this onei am slightly older than mr forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as himthese laws and the emphasis on the islamic threat will just do the sameforsyth is wrongif the government can hold suspects without charge or trial whats nextthat does not mean that the civil liberties of modern britain must be eroded to counter the threat that should always be the absolute last resortthe government is seeking to introduce a police statethat goes right back to magna carta and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they knew bestmr forsyth seems to forget that killings in the troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sideslike new labour he believed he was promoting the peoples best interestsjust look at the facts  our government along with the us invaded another sovereign country iraq by selecting intelligence that backed its case based on fearthese people will use devastating force against us without fear of any consequencefrederick forsyth puts it beautifullyterrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and libertiesthe mortal threat back then was a scruffy little austrian called adolf hitlermr forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongsthe governments approach is totally against the spirit of british democracyi am against a police state and would not like to think that i lived in onebut history has shown that if you have laws like that they always get abused by those in powerthe single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purposenow the threat is islamic fundamentalismi dont usually have much time for mr forsyths largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot onit is frederick forsyth who is the extremist because he does not appreciate the need for balancethis government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rightsthe problem with this issue is not that it isnt important but the fact that in general we brits can be so politically apathetic some times that we will just let this go without telling the government nothe citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge but the whim of a political activist called a government ministernow the blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communismat this time let us not forget suspects foreign and british were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war without any complaints from the publicthe new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory id cards and the linking of data bases together with the unbritish idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 yearsif we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period we are no better that those we are fightingbecause these terrorists are potentially so deadly we have to come up with new tougher responsesthe idea that the new terrorism demands new powers is erroneousyou now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessiblehowever as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty i hope this will prove to be one step too farit is based and funded abroad so was the irathis puts it on a par with the government of burmathirty more years 300 policemen and women over 600 soldiers more than 3000 civilians dead but we won because even ira bombs could not force us to become a tyrannythe terrorists have already wonlike new labour he called himself a libertarianapart from a number of prisoners in belmarsh goal for examplethis country signs up to human rights and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear the innocent people defined by whomsurely we the public would be better protected if the security services rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest and for how longand without becoming a tyrannywhen you look at todays britain you realise george orwell was only wrong about one thing the datebut as forsythe criticises this government hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitariansit has sleeper fanatics inside our society so did the irajust because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terroristyou cannot compare the threats of past years with nowour freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothingi agreeif they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial there probably isnt anylord falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties
