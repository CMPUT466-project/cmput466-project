it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the governments response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egyptthe prime minister denied all that as well repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaignand he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job and would continue doing it  although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the electionso why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr browns longarranged keynote speech on aid and debt he was askedit dominated the prime ministers monthly news conference which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbourall this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had as a result started to set out his own platformas far as the timing of the prime ministers press conference is concerned there are two optionsthe first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the momentand he repeated what a great man gordon was and how united they were before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the worldthis time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the governments global aid and debt initiatives particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster  an issue many hoped and believed was above such thingseither way the effect was the same  to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue
