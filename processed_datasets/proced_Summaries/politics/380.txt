the increase in minimum wage is a good thingas a graduate working for minimum wage i welcome any increase of pay i can getthe increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my businessa minimum wage just makes people complacentalthough i would not deny people the minimum wage increase its timing stinksi thank mr
blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wagethe minimum wage will rise in october benefiting more than 1m people the government has announcedi dont believe in the minimum wage at allthis is great news but that might be because i work for minimum wagehopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our ownthe other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses  it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage  this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the lower status jobsi think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn themthe trade unions congress welcomed the increase but has called for a £6 minimum wage by next yearthe government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wageif the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the £600 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt  namely minei currently employ 42 staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wageaccording to the commission many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage challengingwe must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroadhowever for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them would you be happy to work for less than £505 an houri cant believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wageas an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional £5000 per yearour minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage yet our economy per person is only 23rds of the usby increasing overheads for business there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt or that pair of trainers for next to nothingthe recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to iti might add that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wageswe all remember michael howards protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced  funny how hes gone quiet on that onein answer to emma from sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end
on the contrary mr blair wins  he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as wellunveiling the latest increase mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a symbol of decency and fairnessconservative leader michael howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not seek to disturb the increasehow many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirementalthough we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differentialthe government says most of those on the minimum wage are women  with many working in cleaning catering shops and hairdressinga £3 per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for 16 to 17yearolds but apprentices are exempti work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services  domestic catering  portering etc  pay the minimum wage of £485 as the basic rateandrew in derby complains that raising the minimum wage is blatant electioneeringthe minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a workers relationship with their employerwith the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removedwe cant afford not to pay a decent wageas an employee for a small nursery i know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last octobers increase for the lower paid employees  who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimumbut the confederation of british industry cbi called for a pause year to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in octoberits true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand outi hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury wont take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back doorthis was only 2 years ago and i was getting paid £275 an hour and working as hard as any of the older staff maybe its about time 16  21 year olds got a fair wagealso i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after youi am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workersin the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay for example a job i did in plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in exeter by 75p an hourthe national minimum wage is currently set at £485 per hour for those aged 22 and above and at £410 for those aged 18 to 21if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe its not being run properly and if it folds a betterrun company will take over its duties and employ more people so everybody wins except incompetent business ownersthe liberal democrats economics spokesman vincent cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wagei think if any job is worth doing then its worth being paid a fair wage for and £505 is hardly a fortunei feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people cant afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in lifeif the rate rises to £6 then i can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employeesfor too long wages were a point of exploitation  what could an employer get away withi have my gcses alevels and a degree and have chosen to work for a small business that cant afford the wages i should be getting i should be on at least 3x what im getting but they cant afford itin very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep lowpaid wages lowgreat keep at it tony i remember the despair of the 80s and the low wages employers got away withbusinesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firmwhile im delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward i am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesseswe are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us
