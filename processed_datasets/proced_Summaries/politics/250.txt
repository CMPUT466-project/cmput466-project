the issue that we think is the most important for this election is choicewe have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraqwe would like the support of political parties but i think a general election is very much to do with pledges mps make to their electorsa general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policytuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle thats an increase of about £750whether or not we will get a ban i am not surewe will seek to get pledges from individual mps and wouldbe mps saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sportspensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of adair turners full report into the issuepoliticians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issueif weve got one in five pensioners below the poverty line weve got to make it more generous or have these people living in povertyhe wanted the issue off the table until after the electionbut there is no guarantee they will vote for a labour government this time aroundwith hunting we had many mps who were happy to say they were against itits become an issue in itself but whats really missing from the debate is the consumers choice in thatwe have seen so many pensions misselling scandals and in the pensions industry theres a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in thatwhatever we do the public dont like lorries  they see us as a complaining minoritythey will be asked which of the top five issues including the pension issue they would supportwe want choice on the consumers terms  that means clear and accessible information to operate that choicei think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agendaweve called for the state pension to be increased from £7960 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of £10545people using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroadwe are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing votersregrettably its one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national presswhichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering timeeverything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a banchoice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schoolsit is hard to say whether we will be successfulwe will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the ukthe language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrumbut they dont realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work when you see a lorry its already at workthe reason for including abroad is because of trophy huntingwe havent worked out specific plans but i imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent mps
