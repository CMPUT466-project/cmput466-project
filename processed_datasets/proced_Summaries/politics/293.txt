he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroysilk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye he saidukip officials also argue mr kilroysilk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to leadmr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroysilk would deliver better as the leader of a eurosceptic partygood luck to kilroy though i think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battlemr kilroysilk quit ukip last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that partythank goodness that kilroysilk has gone  now ukip at least has a chance in the electionlets hope kilroysilk ukip and the eurosceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europemr kilroysilk who recently quit the uk independence party said our country was being stolen from us by mass immigrationi think mr kilroysilk has got a very good pointkilroysilk was made an mep because of his position on the ukips party listthe sooner we leave this corrupt superstate the better  does anyone else think that it is ironic that eurosceptic kilroysilk has used a latin name for his new party rather than a good old british namewhile ukip has turned its back on the british people i shall not he saidhopefully this all this fighting within eurosceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issueexbbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroysilk said he wanted to change the face of british politics as he launched his new partygood to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always doneman with tan leaves party with no plan to set up party with no ideathe electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroysilk but for the ukipits leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroysilkthis kilroysilk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own partyukip leader roger knapman says he is glad to see the back of mr kilroysilkas the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europeits all well and good robert kilroysilk claiming that veritas is a party that doesnt believe in lies and spin but the truth of the matter is its completely useless due to proportional representation there is no chance that veritas will have any chance in claiming power and change the twohorse race trendveritas is the beginning of the end for kilroysilkthis new party seems a logical next step for kilroyukips chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have leftbrilliant about time this country had a plausible partyits all flash and no real policy here  lets hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroysilk slipping into obscuritywhilst not being a great fan of kilroy i do agree with his comments about the ukip leadership and like him i am also leaving ukiphaving multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote furtherthe party asserts that mr hockney has a moral obligation if not a legal one to stand downrobert kilroysilk could have a lot to offerkilroysilk may just have those very qualitiesukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the euwhatever kilroysilk and ukip do none of their antieuropean policies have any relevance outside middle englandinstead we have a split party and a damaged causekilroy has one agenda  the uk  and ill be voting for himif mr kilroysilk lives up to half his promises he will get my voteon thursday mr kilroysilk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election  that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoons ashfield seatmr kilroysilk promised a firm but fair policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general electionhaving seen the recent bbc 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figures i can well understand why kilroysilk feels embarrassed to be associated with such peoplehe said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last junes european electionsinteresting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin namelast summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroysilkukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy himbritish politics has become too pc and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politiciansi wouldnt write off kilroysilkthe very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseatingunder the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representationkilroy silk has secured my vote and many more like mekilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician in exactly the way those who lead ukip are notkilroysilk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issuehe was joined in the new venture by one of ukips two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas deputy leaderif he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a byelections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to anotherso ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow
