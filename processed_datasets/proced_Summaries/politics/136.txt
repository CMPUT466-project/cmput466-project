mr straw said it was wrong to put china under the same embargo as countries such as zimbabwe and burmathe level of human rights was a key criteria under the eu arms exports code he saidhuman rights groups say the code of conduct is not legally binding  but mr straw said it would be given legal force by the laws of many eu countriesuk foreign secretary jack straw who will hold talks in beijing on thursday said an eu arms code was more effective than the current banin the uk more export licences were refused under the existing european union arms code than under the embargo he saidthe code of conduct is much more effective its a more powerful tool of and we intend to strengthen it as a precondition of lifting the embargo with china he saidmr straw denied the decision would suggest to china that tiananmen square had been forgottenmr ancram argued what the british government is doing is giving in to french and german pressure especially the french who see vast contracts available to them if the embargo is lifted
it gives the wrong signals to china who are simply not prepared to accept that what happened at tiananmen square was wrongand only two of the licences denied under the embargo would have been granted under the codein december the eu pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet
