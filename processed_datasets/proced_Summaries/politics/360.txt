mr brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election should labour winthat is the size of the financial black hole the tories backed by some independent forecasters believe mr brown will have to fill with tax increases after the electionthe opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound increase spending and cut taxes at the same timethe liberal democrats will also promise to run a sound economy but based on increased taxes to fund spending and amongst other things abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income taxthe opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims a treasury leak suggested mr brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cashand needless to say there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the budget will have on mr browns own ambitions to replace mr blair as prime minister at some point after a third winbut mr brown will stun westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters faces and make them more inclined to back labour in the electionbut probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years
