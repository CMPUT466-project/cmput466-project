angels is a great song but not the best song of the last 25 yearswhilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbies repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 yearsbest song of the last 25 yearsbest song in the last 25 yearsi think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i dont think its the best song from the past 25 yearsrobbie williams angels was named the best song of the past 25 yearsits alright for a pop song  but the best song of the last 25 yearsbest song in 25 yearsalthough angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 yearsa great song yes but the best of the last 25 yearsthats why it has been voted best song of the last 25 yearsangels is without doubt a great song but i really dont think it deserves the title of best song in 25 yearsperhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual songthe best song of the past 25 yearsive nothing against robbie i actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25yearif this is the best song of the last 25 years then the british music industry is in troublethe initial list was very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last 25 yearsbut it is no way the best song of the past 25 yearsim actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 yearsbooo hisss  angels best songi very much doubt that angels was even the best song of the week that it came outwhat a load of crap best song in the last 25 years  i dont think sowhile i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won in all seriousness i think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of noveltybest song in 25 years you must be jokingonly the best song to be up for nomination at the britswhy a halfbaked cheesy ditty like angels which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example and by whom should be voted the best song of the past 25 years is beyond mei am a regular listener to radio 2 but i dont recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldnt know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last 25 yearsthere is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 yearsits a travestyok i like robbie and angels is a decent songi think that although robbie williams is a good performer that angels isnt really that good a songangels is a fantastic songyes angels is the best song since the past 25 years because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaningangels isnt a bad songpersonally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heardbest of the last 25 yearsi am a huge robbie fan and love that songthink of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angelsthere must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award morei think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for herethere must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kidswilliams track beat songs by will young queen kate bush and joy division in a vote by bbc radio 2 listeners to mark 25 years of the uk music industry ceremonybut i think there are a lot more outstanding songs  music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the lista sad day for music  its not the type of music i normally like but even as a diehard rock fan i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most peopleangels is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to itthe success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last 25 yearsit is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to comemcfly won the best pop act prize and gwen stefani picked up the best international female artist awardi find it hard to believe that angels is the best we have to show for the past 25 yearsthe flamboyant act scored a hattrick in the international categories winning the best group best album and best newcomer awardswhat about all the real artists out there over the last 25 years  the list is endless but robbie williams doesnt even come closeit should have been joy divisionthose guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop songits a terrible song voted for by the masses who dont have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting musiclittle britain comedy duo matt lucas and david walliams presented the best song prize to robbie williams dressed as his former take that colleagues gary barlow and howard donald leading him to quip he was always the talented man of the bandsome people will adopt their slightly snobby stances but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other songthe song is overplayed and oversentimentalgranted angels is a good song however it really wasnt up against any other proper competitionright enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what was will young doing being nominated in the first place  he is alright but the song isnt that goodthere were other great songs in the category
but somebody had to winmuch better songs and more timelessphil collins doesnt deserve awards for all the good songs he wrotealso why werent the stones there david bowie etc there are so many greater songs than angelsi wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasnt getting more awards so they had to make one up for himthe us band who opened the show with take your mama won the best international act and newcomer awards as well as best international albumfranz ferdinand who were shortlisted in five categories won best rock act and best british group an award they dedicated to late dj john peelits a mediocre sentimental and safe songkeane won best british album and breakthrough actif this is the song against which all others are judged then musicians may as well give upnatasha bedingfield  in the running for best british female and best pop act  performed with her brother daniel for the first time at wednesdays eventa band who through two albums have had a bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last 25 years than robbie williams ever willsoppy rubbish at bestit just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy divisionthat song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word angels where i thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tells me the radios offit seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who dont particularly like music all that muchthe song makes me calm and serene and happythe queens song was lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices were patheticwill young won the best single prize for your gamerobbie has millions of loyal fans while even nonfans know the words to angelsif you voted for it  you should feel ashamed of yourself  you probably only know a dozen songs or so dont you  so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous votei think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different peopleviewers of digital music tv channel mtv base voted stone the winner in the best urban act categoryim rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaningtheres not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feelingsure robbie is talented and produces excellent material but this is not the best recordits a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groupsthey werent cool at the time but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people thinkrobbie was a deserved winnerwhy must best always come down to most commercially popularjust like robbieafter beating amy winehouse jamelia natasha bedingfield and pj harvey to the best british female prize joss stone said i dont know what to sayglasgow group franz ferdinand won two prizes as did keane and joss stone who was voted best urban act by digital tv viewersbest british male artist winner mike skinner  aka the streets  does not usually attend award ceremonies but the birmingham hiphop artist performed his hit dry your eyes at the ceremonywhenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up smile and sing along very badly that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice outthen again well done robbie good showbut they missed out on best british live act which went to musewhenever we have these awards it is always artists from the past five years that seem to win the best of the bestwe forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example
