one puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe 90i have fond memories of bod not least of which because i look like him and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a filmwould have loved to see dungeons  dragons made but unfortunately the film that it was made into didnt come up to scratchits all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a new audience but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving itit maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never going to live up to expectationpart of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expecti believe that childrens classics should be left well alone and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie popular among children because its original witty and modernthe thunderbirds film was apalling not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompsonthere are plany of modern childrens book that would make excellent films or tv programmes why not use them instead of rehashing the pastwell if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martinpersonally id like to see cartoons such as transformers thundercats and maskit would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joes carcould morph hold his own in a big screen moviethe only one that isnt to be remade as yet is thundercats which id like to seethe magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years agoim only 27 and dont remember the series from when it was on tv but have the set on dvd and its a classicthe new version of the magic roundabout which will be released as sprungpersonally i think it shows that no one has any originality any moreor even jamie and the magic torchhmmmmm i could go on and onthats the appeal though its so innocent like chorlton himself and it would be a real shame if they did remake itthe new bigscreen version of the magic roundabout released in the uk on friday is the latest attempt to turn childrens television into boxoffice goldseems that the film and tv is doing the same now  its just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them rather than being daring and trying something newshould be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put injust looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preservedid like to see mr
benn with brad pitt in the title rolethis regurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry  it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other peoples ideas because it guarantees to bring in the films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first placeperhaps if the remakes were done in a look around you mockauthentic style i might be interested 
 chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch that would be megai recently rewatched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in danger mouse that was completely lost on me when i was a childhow about classics like chorlton and the wheelies rentaghost terrahawks bodoh the list could go on and onagain like so many of these nostalgia programmes the animation  this time computer created flatcell like animation  failed to match the originals cut out paper technique for inventiveness and was woefully inadequatedan jolin reviews editor of empire magazine says classic childrens tv shows have a builtin audience that make them ideal for reinventionit was only that thunderbirds the movie was targetted as a childrent movie that really let it downbut then again it couldnt be better than the original series could itmy dearest wish however is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screenid luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the sametv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes djs are sampling or reworking 70s and 80s musicid hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation  i love that done in a shed clunkiness and you couldnt recreate the magicall i can say is bring back danger mouse probably the greatest kids show everlove to see transformers with real actors and cgijust imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in a remake of fingerbobs
the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more lifelike fingermouse  bob the builder postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire post and bricksthere was a new captain pugwash cartoon made a couple of years backand the recent puppet comedy team america world police was in part provoked by its directors outrage that gerry andersons thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequinsdespite thunderbirds disappointing global boxoffice performance  the film cost 42m £22m but only recouped 21m £11m  the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abatingi think remakes are a good ideathe magic roundabout is out in the uk on 11 februarymake a movie version of the banana splitsor perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandywith screen versions of the ateam the dukes of hazzard and even blakes seven on the cards nostalgia is clearly big businessif they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be greatthe problem with bringing it to the big screen is that noone could approach oliver postgates wonderful voices  noggin the nog was one of the best childrens programsits always nice to see these old toons rereleased but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie and the songbut of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairsit does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made are filmmakers running out of original ideas
