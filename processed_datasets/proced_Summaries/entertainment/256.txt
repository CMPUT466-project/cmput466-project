and so what of urban musicurban is a nonsense term  music of black originurban seems to be the new name for all styles of black musicif there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain i think thats where you can call it urban  thats where this new subcategory or ubercategory has come fromstop puting it all in brackets and lets just call it music and lets especially drop the black  urban tag  nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colourwe are urban music as far as im concernedurban is pc version for saying black musicif joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted toothey are both 10 times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos  but why not britssurely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is historically considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate fromher victory has reignited the debate about what urban music isshe makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urbanher music is great soul and surely that is under the urban bannerexcluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surelyshe did deserve it but i agree with the comments about urban musicjoss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country musici dont feel like urban musics just been celebrated by joss stone winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that theres an urban music scene because its all a kick in the teeth at the end of the dayits music you like it or you dontthe word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that its wronga type of music especially street music that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban lifethe great thing about urban music is that theres a big rangeurban is just a word thats come about recently to describe black music thats become popular nowblack people should lead the music they invented ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commoditylook at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift musicyou have said it there is music you like and music you dont like  who cares what label you put on itthe real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were blackthe very term music of black origin has confused and offended many peoplewhat urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black backgroundso what if joss stone won the urban awardsall this urban and other such categorisation is just the redtape of the music business and is best ignoredthe music industry isnt championing music from our particular genre very well anywaythe term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblindit appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortableif anyone deserves to win an award for urban music i think probably should include hiphop soul  funk at least but not rock or pop this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim  she definitely deserved to win a prize joss stones albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last yearthe term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awardsjoss stone deserved to win an award for her talents but i dont think it was very urban of her to sing angels with robbie williamshow far are the brits removed from innercity music and what people are doingits a word thats been manufactured in this country and america to describe black musicjoss stone a 17yearold soul singer from devon beat dizzee rascal jamelia lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awardsif we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it representsthis whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who werent nominated or didnt winin truth its a lazy term to categorise music that you dont really understandif people want to call it urban why notignore the labels it is what it is just musicwhy does music have to be put into a genremusic made in the inner citieswhilst i agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has wonso what youre saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isnt blacki love joss to bits and dont care what her branding is  its amazing music full stopif lemar who makes music which is less soulful than joss work won he might have said nothingim not really comfortable with the word urbanthis is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awardstheres only two kinds of music good and badi demand a prize for rural musicurban as a genre is very broad
