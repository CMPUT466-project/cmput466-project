thisisanumber
thisisanumber
with
that
desire
and
passion
and
that
can
only
be
brought
about
by
the
coaches
surrounding
practice
is
something
you
cant
them
and
all
they
have
to
do
is
give

international
from
thisisanumber
the
olympics

were
mainly
due
to
the
work
i
put
in
on
building
up
my
to
putting
in
thisisanumber
effort
and
i
think
i
am
capable
of
doing
the
second
time
in
their
history
when
carlos
moya
beat
the
usas
andy
roddick
in
the
fourth
rubber
in
thisisanumber
to
give
the
hosts
an
unassailable
thisisanumber
lead
with
only
one
singles
rubber
in
the
second
set
but
moyas
claycourt
expertise
proved
the
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
in
the
final
dead
rubber
to
cut
spains
winning
margin
to
came
in
thisisanumber
when
they
beat
australia
in
the
final
in
seville
and
the
citys
olympic
stadium
was
revamped
to
allow
for
a
record
crowd
for
a
competitve
tennis
event
of
thisisanumber
support
to
their
players
with
thisisanumber
nadal
and
moya
winning
both
fridays
singles
gave
the
visitors
hope
with
victory
over
juan
carlos
ferrero
and
tommy
robredo
in
saturdays
for
a
us
team
far
happier
on
hard
courts
than
clay
and
thisisanumber
french
open
champion
moya
had
too
much
for
world
number
two
ive
been
waiting
for
for
years
said
moya
who
missed
out
in
thisisanumber
through
i
would
have
my
chances
to
ive
lived
today
moya
stormed
into
a
thisisanumber
lead
on
his
way
to
taking
the
first
set
against
roddick
and
recovered
immediately
from
dropping
serve
in
the
tiebreaks
and
moya
dominated
both
clinching
victory
on
his
third
match
moya
congratulated
by
his
teammates
including
nadal
who
at
thisisanumber
years
and
thisisanumber
days
becomes
the
youngest
ever
victor
in
davis
cup
better
fight
here
than
in
paris
two
years
ago
said
roddick
who
was
on
the
us
team
which
lost
to
france
in
the
thisisanumber
semifinals
at
roland
this
of
i
gave
it
my
out
of
here
with
my
head
down
thats
for
leading
lady
to
withdraw
from
the
australian
open
because
of
slam
of
thisisanumber
which
begins
on
thisisanumber
january
said
the
american
has
a
problem
with
her
right
the
womens
draw
as
last
years
champion
justin
heninhardenne
and
runnerup
kim
clijsters
will
also
be
melbourne
with
wins
in
thisisanumber
and
up
the
injury
at
the
advanta
championships
at
philadelphia
in
november
and

off

nicolas
massu
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
replaced
paradorn
srichaphan
thisisanumber
the
year
only
faltering
against
nalbandian
when
serving
for
the
match
at
to
win
the
next
two
games
for
only
his
second
win
in
six
matches
against
the
year
just
what
i
was
looking
for
henman
told
his
very
difficult
to
play
hes
deceptively
effective
from
the
baseline
so
sometimes
it
can
be
difficult
to
execute
my
gameplan
well
enough
against
him
to
get
the
right
always
good
for
the
confidence
and
it
bodes
well
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
henman
also
revealed
the
extent
of
the
back
problems
he
suffered
in
the
at
the
end
of
the
year
i
was
pretty
exhausted
and
wanted
to
have
a
couple
of
weeks
where
i
didnt
do
anything
said
really
really
seized
two
weeks
off
i
dont
think
its
so
productive
federer
dropped
a
tight
first
set
against
thisisanumber
french
open
champion
gaudio
but
was
content
with
his
the
surface
he
doha
my
timing
was
ok
but
i
could
have
served
the
match
and
i
won
it
thats
a
good
and
hopefully
play
better
the
next
match
agassi
was
delighted
with
victory
over
massu
in
his
first
match
for
over
two
played
out
and
maybe
excluding
a
few
second
serve
returns
i
felt
like
i
was
doing
most
things
pretty
darn
well
for
the
first
victory
as
the
highlight
of
his
career
after
he
beat
andy
roddick
to
end
the
usas
challenge
in
thisisanumber
victory
through
injury
by
beating
roddick
thisisanumber

not

two
years
ago
in
valencia
when
they
beat
davis

my
dream
and
i
was
a
bit
nervous
at
the

i
think
that
it
is
better
this
if
i
am
winning

is
really
something
spanish

said
charly
played
a
great
hasnt
let
us
roddick
and
this
was
his
day
to
beat

the
youngest

further
dissatisfaction
after
the
the

players
he
had
very
little
to
i

arrese

great
doubles
player
the
ultimate
after

the

youre
the
best
how
right
he
titles
from
thisisanumber
finals
during
thisisanumber
three
of
them
grand
slams
and
thisisanumber
final
victories
in
a
row
going
back
to
vienna
form
which
easily
matched
his
grand
slamwinning
efforts
of
thisisanumber
and
marat
safin
is
sure
to
be
prominent
during
fighting
for
the
world
number
two
even
federer
himself
the
swiss
star
is
in
a
different
little
bit
he
told
bbc
because
i
have
beaten
them
now
and
i
hope
it
continues
the
number

also
the
main

promoting
the

off
the
international
tennis
writers
as
the

into
yet
another
tape
day
on
the
tour
so
to
give
away
an
hour
for
interviews
is
really
no
problem
for
the
sport
then
that
is
good
for
is
nice
what
a
refreshing
attitude
from
someone
who
could
easily
dominate
the
sports
pages
for
a
trophy
a
mercedes
convertible
and
a
tasty
cheque
for
thisisanumber
federer
addressed
the
houston
crowd
and
concluded
by
saying
thanks
for
having
a
way
of
winning
the
french
open
the
one
grand
slam
to
so
far
elude
their
opening
matches
at
the
tour
championships
in
los
thisisanumber
while
wimbledon
champion
sharapova
was
a
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
winner
over
fellow
russian
svetlana
russian
elena
dementieva
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
for
her
second
victory
of
the
groups
of
four
with
the
top
two
from
each
advancing
to
the
a
row
as
she
tries
to
overtake
lindsay
davenport
for
the
number
one
one
after
the
us
open
before
injury
ushered
davenport
back
in
on
court
and
my
game
is
back
but
its
very
different
than
before
i
was
number
i
take
it
in
a
relaxed
way
mauresmo
completed
her
first
match
in
the
seasonending
championship
in
thisisanumber
minutes
as
russias
zvonareva
struggled
to
return
her
serve
and
failed
to
achieve
a
single
break
and
i
played
some
great
tennis
said
mauresmo
who
was
runnerup
to
kim
clijsters
in
last
years
so
far
having
crashed
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
kuznetsova
in
the
staples
centre
on
do
lost
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
to
kuznetsova
in
beijing
in
september
said
in
beijing
she
was
coming
off
such
a
big
winning
streak
thisisanumber
matches
and
she
was
start
off
well
and
put
some
pressure
on
her
the
tournament
debutant
added
i
love
it
play
you
just
feel
that
is
still
some
way
off
her
best
form
but
remained
positive
after
two
wins
in
two
and
get
it
right
but
im
fighting
and
im
hoping
said
to
my
open
was
put
in
doubt
after
he
pulled
out
of
the
kooyong
classic
with
a
hip
in
the
first
set
to
fellow
american
andy
roddick
when
he
decided
to
bring
a
premature
end
to
the
just
could
not
continue
said
the
open
four
times
will
have
an
mri
scan
to
discover
the
extent
of
the
the
same
as
the
hip
injury
which
forced
him
to
miss
wimbledon
last
didnt
just
tear
it
was
tightening
up
and
that
can
be
your
body
protecting
itself
which
is
hopefully
more
of
the
issue
he
all
what
i
was
what
im
dealing
with
its
a
pretty
scary
feeling
out
there
when
something
doesnt
feel
right
and
is
getting
to
do
my
best
to
deal
with
the
australian
open
is
a
possibility
or
being
the
end
of
the
day
for
have
a
much
better
sense
of
what
my
hopes
will
face
frances
cyril
saulnier
in
the
first
round
of
next
weeks
australian
is
in
the
same
quarter
of
the
draw
and
could
face
andy
roddick
in
the
second
round
if
he
beats
swede
jonas
frances
arnaud
clement
while
defending
champion
and
world
number
one
roger
federer
faces
fabrice
spanish
veteran
conchita
to
defeat
saulnier
in
the
first
round
of
the
french
open
last
year
so
he
knows
he
faces
a
tough
test
in
gone
beyond
the
quarterfinals
in
the
years
first
major
and
is
lined
up
to
meet
roddick
in
the
last
eight
is
looking
forward
to
the
hes
got
a
lot
of
ability
he
in
paris
that
went
my
way
so
im
going
to
need
to
play
well
from
the
outset
because
hes
a
dangerous
competitor
switzerlands
federer
seeded
one
is
the
hot
favourite
having
won
three
of
the
four
grand
slam
titles
in
of
their
seven
previous
encounters
but
is
taking
nothing
for
open
and
won
quite
comfortably
rhythm
is
a
bit
off
he
can
keep
you
guessing
and
make
it
to
get
used
to
playing
fiveset
matches
and
winning
them
the
thisisanumber
could
meet
fourtime
champion
andre
agassi
in
the
quarterfinals
before
meeting
russian
marat
safin
the
player
he
beat
in
last
years
play
a
qualifier
in
round
one
if
he
can
shake
off
a
hip
injury
which
ruled
him
out
of
the
kooyong
his
campaign
against
irakli
labadze
of
the
second
round
seventh
seed
henman
in
the
quarterfinals
and
hewitt
in
the
last
first
australian
man
to
win
the
event
since
mark
edmondson
in
round
four
in
eight
attempts
at
melbourne
park
but
has
at

secured
the
opposite
half
of

to

beat
him
in

and

saying
he
was
looking

to
trying

make
up
for
his

by

after
testing

french

but
now
plans
to
lodge
an
him
by
an
austrian
doctor
to
treat
a

is
to
blame
for
producing
traces

that
i
not

will
miss
the
australian
open
but
also
the

in

alive
with
a

after
coming
through

thisisanumber
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
down
and
trailed
in
both
tiebreaks
but
would
not
be
denied
thrilling
the
melbourne
crowd
with
a
typically
battling
first
australian
winner
since
mark
edmondson
in
make
the
final
since
pat
cash
lost
to
mats
wilander
in
thisisanumber
but
faces
a
huge
challenge
against
safin
the
conqueror
of
roger
last
two
matches
there
was
reason
to
think
hewitt
might
struggle
for
dropping
his
opening
service
game
and
roddick
dominated
with
his
huge
serve
as
he
took
the
first
second
the
key
moment
came
when
hewitt
raised
his
game
in
the
tiebreak
to
overturn
an
early
was
not
finished
and
raced
thisisanumber
clear
in
the
crucial
third
before
hewitt
pegged
him
back
and
forced
another
hewitt
fought
back
taking
the
lead
with
a
superb
backhand
denied
and
a
disheartened
roddick
made
little
impact
in
the
fourth
set
as
hewitt
raced
to
victory
sending
the
melbourne
crowd
wild
and
ensuring
the
final
will
be
a
huge
nine
months
yards
to
get
to
get
in
the
first
night
final
at
the
australian
was
furious
with
himself
for
failing
to
take
advantage
of
leads
in
both
said
given
me
a
distinct
in
there
with
a
win
big
i
would
have
wanted
and
the
american
played
down
the
influence
of
one
spectator
who
appeared
to
contribute
to
a
double
fault
by
shouting
during
rodicks
service
shout
out
said
roddick
adding
that
the
crowd
overall
was
very
the
australian
open
courts
at
melbourne
park
after
criticism
of
the
playing
surface
by
lleyton
gutful
of
trying
to
persuade
them
to
make
the
surface
faster
but
tennis
australias
geoff
pollard
rejected
his
be
made
faster
than
last
year
and
to
my
knowledge
it
is
faster
he
money
on
modifications
to
make
it
faster
hewitt
who
has
not
got
past
the
fourth
round
at
melbourne
in
seven
attempts
had
earlier
said
the
surface
was
not
worthy
of
such
a
prestigious
on
whatever
surface
he
had
to
in
order
to
have
a
chance
of
and
pollard
said
the
surface
had
been
speeded
up
since
last
years
tournament
following
complaints
by
several
australian
the
melbourne
surface
may
have
had
a
bearing
on
hewitts
performances
over
the
on
all
surfaces
he
and
thatll
be
faster
than
the
one
lleyton
beat
roger
federer
on
in
the
davis
cup
in
to
beat
lindsay
davenport
and
win
her
second
australian
open
grand
slam
title
and
her
first
since
wimbledon
in
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
with
a
rib
injury
when
she
left
the
court
for
treatment
after
five
but
from
thisisanumber
in
the
second
found
another
gear
as
davenports
game
collapsed
allowing
williams
to
take
the
saying
it
was
the
result
of
lunging
for
a
ball
early
in
the
first
out
wide
on
my
backhand
and
my
back
went
but
eventually
i
was
able
to
come
back
thank
goodness
she
shes
had
a
tough
couple
of
years
and
shes
come
back
like
a
championthe
thisisanumber
former
world
number
one
was
in
desperate
trouble
in
the
early
stages
as
the
injury
hampered
her
service
the
opening
set
and
held
six
break
points
in
game
five
of
the
not
losing
this
game
said
williams
falls
off
im
not
losing
this
particular
game
because
it
would
have
given
her
a
lot
of
momentum
and
a
lot
of
confidence
despite
letting
the
break
points
slip
away
davenport
looked
comfortable
enough
at
thisisanumber
but
from
thisisanumber
up
she
just
the
set
and
powered
through
the
decider
as
a
lacklustre
davenport
looked
to
have
run
out
of
energy
after
a
gruelling
two
well
and
in
control
pretty
much
of
the
match
said
lapse
i
think
serving
up
thisisanumber
and
made
a
few
errors
and
opened
up
the
door
for
her
and
she
just
kept
going
through
was
a
little
bit
fatigued
but
she
took
advantage
of
it
and
kept
going
shes
a
great
frontrunner
when
she
gets
has
ruled
out
any
chance
of
winning

how

do
you
have
how
much
do
you
hate

are
the
questions
jimmy
connors
will
be
asking
of
britains
brightest
tennis
hopes
in
the
months
and
possibly
years
to
on
thursday
to
announce
a
longterm
relationship
with
the
lawn
tennis
association
after
spending
three
days
at
the
elite
performance
winter
camp
in
la
phrase
will
to
win
before
lleyton
hewitt
was
even
born
is
clear
about
the
qualities
he
hopes
to
well
and
theres
a
very
fine
line
between
number
one
and
number
thisisanumber
said
a
long
want
to
be
part
of
teaching
kids
how
to
winconnors
is
not
the
first
great
name
to
offer
his
services
to
the
lta
his
longtime
rival
john
mcenroe
has
repeatedly
done
the
point
out
that
his
interest
goes
well
beyond
any
publicity
stunt
and
he
gave
a
glowing
recommendation
to
the
work
of
lta
performance
director
david
felgate
and
his
right
attitude
in
taking
the
game
forward
and
finding
the
next
wimbledon
champion
said
not
everybody
puts
that
into
after
just
seeing
david
and
the
other
coaches
for
three
days
was
one
like
ive
never
seen
before
especially
over
overnight
there
are
no
miracle
workers
but
youre
going
in
the
right
direction
the
thisisanumber
enthusiasm
for
the
work
going
on
in
this
country
is
in
marked
contrast
to
his
relationship
with
tennis
officials
back
in
united
states
tennis
association
over
a
number
of
years
he
connors
is
a
straighttalker
and
will
be
equally
blunt
and
honest
in
his
dealings
with
the
lta
and
the
cream
of
britains
young
produce
he
take
their
and
its
lonely
up
there
but
its
got
the
best
view
in
the
year
that
has
seen
andrew
murray
emerge
as
britains
great
new
hope
connors
rejected
suggestions
that
the
scot
might
be
put
under
too
much
pressure
too
on
his
shoulder
said
if
you
like
that
it
can
be
a
certain
push
to
get
on
to
the
next
and
take
over
from
him
embrace
the
emphasis
on
hard
work
training
and
preparation
connors
does
admit
that
the
desire
required
of
a
champion
has
to
come
from
know
if
you
can
find
that

drought
goes

beat
compatriot
kim
clijsters
at
the
australian
heninhardennes

she
was
fit
enough
to
win

clijsters
had
an
even
more
miserable

then
announced
the
end
of

be
happy
to
see

woeful

which
begins
on

january
in

cope
with
repetitive
days
of

said
hopman

doctor
hamish
my
opinion
for
him
to
do
a
fivesetter
once
let
alone
two
days
in
a
row
inside
two
australian
rules
football
and
a
fit
footballer
would
normally
take
three
to
four
weeks
to
recover
fully
although
marks
injury
is
slightly
different
the
australian
has
suffered
a
host
of
injury
problems
throughout
his
career
but
is
still
holding
out
slim
hope
that
he
can
make
the
by
possible
and
try
to
strengthen
it
without
tearing
it
any
more
he
from
this
and
thats
all
that
is
also
a
doubt
for
the
australian
open
after
picking
up
a
thigh
injury
playing
for
germany
in
the
hopman
left
thigh
while
leading
argentine
guillermo

in
its
bid
for

can
draw
upon

over

henman
leaves
davis

tennis
with
an
impressive
record
having
won
thisisanumber
of
his
thisisanumber
tribute
to
henmans
efforts
over
the
phenomenal
davis

career
and
it
has
been
an
absolute
privilege
to
have
captained
the
team
with
him
in
it
said
completely
understand
and
respect
his
decision
to
retire
from
davis
cup
and
focus
on
the
grand
slams
and
obviously
marks
a
watershed
in
british
davis
cup
tennis
but
it
is
also
a
huge
opportunity
for
the
next
generation
to
make
their
players
coming
through
and
despite
losing
someone
of
tims
calibre
i
remain
very
optimistic
about
the

in
the
final
of
the
canberra

the
match
thisisanumber
round
of
qualifying
but
the
hungarian
made
the
main
draw
as
a
lucky
loser
after
katarina
srebotnik
withdrew
in
the
beginning
but
i
pulled
through
and
didnt
do
too
much
wrong
a
junior
wimbledon
finalist
last
year
she
added
its
my
first
wta
title
and
to
win
it
has
really
given
me
more
energy
to
practice

improve

says
the

may
have
been

a
cold

she
wrong
by
taking
the
medicine
during
the

any

because

three
players
that
took
part
in

belgian
justine
heninhardenne
nathalie
dechy
of

russias
elena
has
been
implicated
in
the
you
see
your
face
on
the
cover
page
and
talking
about
doping
dechy
i
think
the
belgian
government
did
a
really
bad
job
about
from
the
you
cannot
say
some
stuff
like
this
saying
its
one
of
these
angry
and
says
that
dechy
and
herself
are
the
real
victims
of
the
have
been
through
all
these
she
this
problem
by
saying
there
are
three
victims
but
i
see
only
two
victims
in
this
story
me
and
nathalie
dechy
who
really
have
nothing
to
do
with
dont
feel
like
i
want
to
talk
to
sveta

everything

was
suffering
another
australian

said
was
because
i
was
thinking
of
the
two
finals
that
i
played
and
wasnt
successful
he
added
you
really
have
to
deal
with
the
pressure
because
normally
it
never
happens
but
when
you
come
to
the
final
you
are
so
tight
because
you
want
to
but
i
two
grand

titles
hes
won
thisisanumber

hes
a
great
player
and
he

thisisanumber
down
in

of

to
reel
off

take
control
of
the
of
a
sudden
it
all
turn
around
completely
in
a
way
i
couldnt
expect
said
mistakes
i
was
a
little
bit
lucky
at
some
point
then
the
confidence
came
back
and
i
was
back
in
the
game
and
the
russian
revealed
that
the
victory
and
his
semifinal
win
over
world
number
one
roger
federer
had
given
him
a
massive
boost
for
the

a
great
player

get
so
much
confidence
in
yourself
that
you
really
can
