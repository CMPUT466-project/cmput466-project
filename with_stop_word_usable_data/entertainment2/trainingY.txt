he
believes
the
american

fails
to
reflect
particularly
how
the

is
perceived
that
he
is
a
the
current
republican

in
a
democratic

which
right
now
is
under

sundance
isnt

with
views
from

end

socially
the

in
an
effort
to
reach
a

what
we
are

is
very
much
good
storytelling
be
it
african
america
asian
women
gay
away
with
those
stereotypical
labels
and
people
will
say
its
just
a
film
by

a
change
of
director
and
a
dramatic
visual
shakeup
that
really
shines
on
found
in
the
two
earlier

alfonso
cuaron
brings
in
a
bleak
and
cold
feel
that
is
simply
gorgeous
and
looks
even
better
here
than
in
the
progression
of
harrys
story
into
darker
areas
but
youll
spend
time
just
marvelling
at
the
beautiful
hogwarts
where
you
get
so
lost
in
the
screen
adaptation
that
you
forget
the
hogwarts
and
studies
are
interrupted
as
they
always
are
by
a
calamity
that
only
harry
ron
and
hermione
can
put

he
is
a
moody
teenager
and
daniel

it
off

becky

a
completely
memorable
character

i
recognised
all
the

to
be

who
wanted
to
buck
the

that
they
were
in

somehow
kept
at

of
my
bed
for
many
years
and
i
would
dip
into
every
now
and
then
and
suddenly
get
completely
mesmerised
it
i
think
it
was
thackerays
clarity
his
clearsightedness
about
his
own
society
the
fact
that
he
was
born
in
india
but
came
to
england
as
a
young
man
that
gave
him
the
eyes
of
an
outsider

he
was
an
lovednair

defended
her
decision
to
cast
an
american
actress

the

that
all
the
rest
of

physically
perfectly
suited
to
the

however
witherspoon
then
became
had
created
the
need
for
some
filming
tricks
it

bob
was
one
of
the
most
mesmeric
people
ive
ever
had
the
privilege
to
work
will
to
was
a
manifest
destiny
within
him
that
he
believed
obvious
he
was
an
extraordinary
song
writer
and
his
stage
act
was
perhaps
the
greatest
ive
ever
recall
in
thisisanumber
he
came
to
the
uk
for
top
of
the
pops
and
a
daily
mirror
journalist
did
a
halfhour
room
to
resume
the

he
wasnt
going

was
in
london
in
four
days
of

indoors
in

it
was
always
a
struggle
for
him
to
connect
with
black
in
the
one
of
the
great
icons
in
america
and
the
third
death
he
sold
more

than
at

for
the
first
time
bob
in
worldwide
terms
is
the
greatest
music
star
there
has
ever
would
be
recognised
everywhere
in
places
john
lennon
or
elvis
wouldnt
but
a
case
can
be
made
for
him
as
the
greatest
the
best
and
the
most
influential
artist
in
popular
music
well
thisisanumber
was
to
be
the
year
he
toured
africa
with
stevie
and
guinea
happened
but
the
whole
of
africa
would
have
embraced
at
the
height
of
his
powers
and
just
thisisanumber
years
was
going
to
go
downhill
bob
was
endlessly
optimistic
about
the
way
africa
would
turn
but
he
had
total
belief
in
the
power
of
today
he
would
believe
africa
would
firstly
become
politically
free
and
secondly
be
able
to
defeat
the
aids
epidemic
the
final
tune
of
his
final
album
was
redemption
song
one
of
the
most
incredible
classics
of
all
best
scottish
band
of
all
time
after
a
three
monthlong
public
into
second
and
third
place
five
brit
award
nominations
ended
up
in
thisisanumber

while
the

wound
up

where
the
result
was

of

were
among
the

who
covered
wellknown

a

career
stretching
back
to
the
brit

for
best

made
it
into
the

list
including

favourites
the

a
list
of
the
top
thisisanumber
scottish
bands
of
all
time
but
left
the
final
decision
to
the
said
the
idea
behind
the
project
was
simple
to
rediscover
the
very
best
of
scottish
music
from
the
finest
musical
talent
spanning
from
the
age
of
thisisanumber
rock
through
to
thisisanumber
pop
right
up
to
todays
international
stars
everyone
has
strong
opinions
about
this
and
we
wanted
to
open
it
up
to
the
public
to
decide
he
who
has
been
involved
in
the
project
said
it
had
been
great
fun
to
look
back
at
scotlands
musical
heritage
and
take
note
of
upandcoming
scottish
has
said
that
dance
music
is
not
dead
but
has
admitted
it
is
currently
going
through
a
fallow
albums
by
britains
two
biggest
dance
acts
fatboy
slims
palookaville
and
the
prodigys
always
outnumbered
never
outgunned
has
been
coupled
with
the
closure
of
many
superclubs
and
the
folding
of
three
dance
music
they
would
no
longer
be
awarding
a
best
dance
act
prize
with
the
brits
committee
announcing
that
dance
music
is
no
longer
where
its
happening
in
music
these
developments
lead
some
to
suggest
that
dance
was
finished
as
a
popular
music
the
dance
world
in
the
four
years
since
his
last
album
halfway
between
the
gutter
and
the
stars
but
he
stressed
this
did
not
mean
the
dance
scene
was
permanently
the
album
i
was
reading
articles
about
the
demise
of
dance
music
and
obviously
that
affects
you
somewhat
he
told
bbc
world
services
the
ticket
dead
or
going
to
die
but
its
going
through
a
bit
of
a
fallow
reading
every
week
that
dance
music
was
dead
i
would
think
right
scrub
that
track
thenalthough
his
album
sales
in
the
uk
are
down
palookaville
stayed
in
the
uk
top
thisisanumber
for
just
three
weeks

achieved
recent
global
success

thisisanumber
people
while
a
later
one
in

achieved
a
crowd
of
was
the
biggest
seller
of
that
the
weathers
nice
the
atmosphere
before
i
even
go
is
so
good
that
about
halfway
through
the
first
record
i
think
ive
got
them
cook
the
big
ones
they
had
to
give
me
valium
before
rio
because
two
hours
before
i
was
literally
just
pacing
the
got
a
reputation
for
it
the
atmosphere
and
the
joie

thats
already
going
on
means
all
i
have
to
do
is
play
up
records

admitted
however
that
his
massive
worldwide

had
a
downside
with

after

was
linked
with

at
times
cook
he
said
that
he
had
been
determined
that
what
had
happened
with
ball
did
not
affect
the
jolly
tunes
so
that
people
wouldnt
think
i
was
depressed
he
and
he
highlighted
a
bizarre
coincidence
that
one
song
written
before
they
split
had
turned
out
to
have
a
great
deal
more
meaning
than
this
track
called

and
left
me
do
you
mind
if
its
on

your
masochistic
baby
did
leave
you

also
added
that
he
had
some
ways
of
coping
with
the
intense

am

as
more
daunting
by
a
long
way
than
their
upcoming
brits
brits
he
go
down
but
i
have
actually
had
to
exercise
part
of
my
brain
tonighti
think
the
government
should
do
more
to
help
upandcoming
artists
be
discovered
by
scrapping
the
entertainment
licences
for
live
help
independent
record
labels
have
a
louder
voice
within
an
industry
dominated
by
commercialised
major
dont
some
of
the
megastars
put
something
back
in
some
of
britains
wealthiest
people
are
musicians
who
have
raked
it
in
from
albums
concerts
on
government
not
fund
musicareas
of
the
arts
are
funded
by
government
and
lottery
grants
so
why
not
music
we
already
have
the
opera
receiving
huge
grants
and
it
would
clearly
be
beneficial
for
diversity
in
music
to
have
the
same
opportunities
in
other
areas
of
the
to
judge
what
merits
state
schools
and
health
multibillion
pound
industry
should
also
have
government
funding
then
his
own
education
was
seriously
lacking
and
more
money
should
be
put
into
i
appreciate
the
value
of
scottish
music
and
culture
being
a
success
so
i
can
see
no
problem
with
it
franz
ferdinand
travis
and
snow
patrol
are
just
recent
examples
of
the
success
scottish
music
can
have
in
the
world
so
we
should
do
what
we
scots
are
good
at
and
support
our
own
goodsi
think
the
issue
is
more
fundamental
should
the
government
be
spending
money
on
subsidising
a
multimillion
pound
industry
when
health
and
education
are
in
such
a
sorry
state
the
answer
is
most
definitely
to
pursue
their
passion
to
get
their
pay
cheque
shouldnt
be
looking
for
government
lucky
enough
to
be
able
to
pursue
my
dream
of
show
jumping
i
would
want
to
finance
myself
until
i
was
in
a
position
to
pursue
corporate
it
brings
joy
to
the
musicians
out
there
sitting
around
twiddling
their
thumbs
on
the
new
would
only
waste
money
that
could
be
put
to
better
funding
real
talent
it
would
be
a
great
pop
idoltype
funding
of
music
though
as
it
would
only
serve
to
reinforce
the
stereotypes
that
alex
talked
amounts
of
tax
on
their
record
sales
if
theyd
had
a
government
grant
to
get
started
theyd
have
more
than
paid
it
back
by
now
so
the
treasury
would
be
making
far
more
than
it
paid
to
spend
its
money
on
than
to
give
charity
to
everyone
who
decides
theyre
a
should
invest
in
music
and
those
investments
should
be
treated
like
any
other
provide
facilities
and
for
young
groups
and
bands
to
form
and
can
be
well
beyond
the
means
of
many
be
the
extent
of
their
role
to
provide
the
conditions
for
the
talent
to
flourish
and
let
it
go
from
should
help
to
fund
music
but
there
is
also
a
responsibility
held
by
record
companies
they
generally
always
opt
for
the
tried
and
tested
and
tend
not
to
want
to
break
any
moulds
or
risk
losing
any
money
which
ultimately
the
directors
are
in
the
business
for
if
labels
were
more
willing
to
put
money
forward
towards
smaller
breakthrough
acts
then
the
government
wouldnt
have
to
fork
out
a
great
government
funded
particularly
the
work
of
modern
composers
and
veteran
bandsartists
and
earth
so
more
attention
should
go
to
the
other
fraternitiesi
agree
with
funding
the
arts
to
make
it
more
accessible
to
the
public
but
i
am
not
convinced
that
pop
music
requires
financial
support
from
the
money
generated
through
pop
music
perhaps
a
tax
on
pop
could
be
ploughed
into
the
public
performance
of
other
forms
of
music
for
everyone
to
bad
pop
idolstyle
music
that
is
the
music
industry
sector
without
any
artistic
merit
or
originality
whatsoever
and
that
which
is
specifically
designed
to
line
the
pockets
of
music
pollution
if
you
i
have
to
disagree
with
mr
the
private
sector
it
will
destroy
the
creative
and
possibly
controversial
avenues
the
artist
case
with
the
us
nea
when
the

started
to
question
what

admitted
he
was
cautious
about

they
had

signed
on

jackson
and
they
enjoyed

enough

it
was
all
sorted

just
mention

im
going

taking

said
stiller

would

that
the

about

would
sail
pretty
close

gervais
is
keen
for
the

to
be
taken
next
three
years
but
i
dont
want
it
to
be
a
thisisanumber
movie
straight
away
because
it
is
not
well

off
my

and
every

but
its
not
important
anymore
the
normally
gregarious
evans
cut
a
peculiarly
unshowbusinesslike
figure
as
he
sipped

coat
and

in

that

your
of

a

a

had
given
the

said
it
was
not
deterring
less
than
i
bought
it
for
but
its
not
really
about
the
its
all
about
he
added
that
he
was
not
going

reveal
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
the
money
he
was
lined

the

although
these
were
not
for
the

there
was
a
healthy
trickle
of
interest
from
the
public
rather
than
the
perhaps
expected
as
they
would
any
of
the
other
stalls
not
knowing
that
it
belonged
to
load
of
a
better
look
but
local

francesca

came
specially
to
the

and
left
happy
with
her
purchase
of

its
a
blatant
but
poor
facsimile
of
something
that
someone
else
has
done
better
thisisanumber
years
you
must
be
sort
of
thing
but
reallylistened
to
angels
on
radio
thisisanumber
this
morning
when
i
was
driving
into
and
memories
when
it
comes
to
voting
for
the
dozen
songs
in
the
last
thisisanumber
years
that
deserve
this
award
be
bothered
to
vote
is
is
pretty
if
that
is
the
best
song
we
have
produced
in
the
last
thisisanumber
yearswhat
about
the
specials
ghost
town
the
buzzcocks
ever
fallen
in
love
with
yes
joy
division
love
will
tear
us
sentimental
fantastically
overrated
a
bit
like
mr
williams
the
brits
has
a
long
history
of
celebrating
rubbish
musicbest
of
the
last
thisisanumber
years
include
stairway
to
heaven
or
bohemian
rhapsody
but
it
does
kind
of
make
it
a
bit
of
a
hollow
award
thisisanumber
years
after
but
the
best
song
of
the
last
thisisanumber
yearsthere
is
no
way
on
earth
that
song
should
have
been
voted
the
best
of
the
last
thisisanumber
yearsits
a
to
be
included
in
any
list
i
am
a
regular
listener
to
radio
thisisanumber
but
i
dont
recall
the
invitation
to
vote
for
this
bland
slushy
rubbish
which
might
appeal
to
the
masses
who
wouldnt
know
a
good
song
if
it
jumped
up
and
bit
them
on
the
nose
but
is
certainly
not
the
best
song
of
the
last
thisisanumber
thought
manufactured
pop
was
on
the
way
out
where
on
earth
did
this
dreadful
list
appear
fromwhile
i
am
biassed
in
that
i
thought
love
will
tear
us
apart
should
have
won
in
all
seriousness
i
think
that
the
best
song
of
the
last
thisisanumber
years
should
not
include
songs
less
than
thisisanumber
years
old
as
that
would
exclude
songs
which
are
popular
because
of
not
the
best
song
of
the
last
thisisanumber
up
for
nomination
at
the
song
and
deserved
to
be
in
the
run
up
for
this
award
but
i
dont
think
its
the
best
song
from
the
past
thisisanumber
years
right
enough
it
is
better
than
some
of
the
others
in
this
catergory
for
example
what
was
will
young
doing
being
nominated
in
the
first
place
he
is
alright
but
the
song
isnt
that
good
im
happy
for
robbie
himself
thoughbest
song
in
the
last
thisisanumber
years
what
a
joke
think
of
all
the
great
rock
and
pop
songs
released
in
the
thisisanumber
and
pretty
much
all
of
them
are
better
than
all
the
good
songs
he
wrote
angels
is
an
overrated
song
that
got
tiresome
even
before
you
had
finished
listening
to
soon
and
let
the
real
artists
who
worked
hard
for
there
glory
receive
the
bland
nature
of
mainstream
music
in
britain
today
for
me
its
proof
that
music
and
democracy
just
dont
of
robbie
has
millions
of
loyal
fans
while
even
nonfans
know
the
words
to
in
these
win
but
that
was
not
really
due
to
his
musical
talenti
hate
the
song
all
it
brings
back
is
memories
of
school
discos
and
noone
to
slowdance
withi
agree
about
radio
i
turn
the
radio
up
smile
and
sing
along
very
badly
that
is
why
the
radio
has
to
be
turned
up
to
drown
my
voice
serene
and
is
a
good
performer
that
angels
isnt
really
that
good
a
good
as
love
will
tear
us
apart
by
joy
division
or
wuthering
heights
by
kate
guy
played
forever
and
bridges
all
age
that
is
always
artists
from
the
past
five
years
that
seem
to
win
the
best
of
the
bestwe
forget
about
the
late
thisisanumber
and
early
thisisanumber
for
but
because
they
are
cool
again
now
shows
that
the
songs
have
greater
longevity
than
people
since
the
past
thisisanumber
years
because
it
touches
the
soul
as
it
carries
a
lot
of
of
the
general
capacity
of
british
preteens
teens
and
middle
aged
women
to
accept
low
quality
low
aspirational
music
as
classic
people
who
like
robbie
are
people
who
dont
particularly
like
music
all
that
never
engaged
in
that
madness
one
experiences
when
falling
under
the
spell
of
pop
an
irritating
distraction
a
wasp
that
refuses
to
go
away
on
a
summers
afternoon
should
feel
ashamed
of
yourself
you
probably
only
know
a
dozen
songs
or
so
dont
you
so
where
do
get
off
applying
this
uninformed
filter
and
casting
this
ridiculous
kidding
right
last
five
years
i
might
be
willing
to
accept
but
thisisanumber
no
have
any
music
knowledge
prior
to
say
thisisanumber
really
quite
insulting
to
the
british
music
industry
of
the
past
quarter
of
a
the
list
come
from
compiled
by
an
eleven
yearold
girl
perhaps
i
mean
will
young
come
song
in
the
last
thisisanumber
years
i
dont
think
so
what
about
all
the
real
artists
out
there
over
the
last
thisisanumber
years
the
list
is
endless
but
robbie
williams
doesnt
even
come
bane
to
me
that
i
have
developed
a
pavlovian
response
to
the
word
angels
where
i
thrash
around
and
scream
no
no
no
no
no
until
someone
tells
me
the
radios
angels
which
has
become
the
anthem
for
millions
of
romantic
sops
think
how
many
times
it
was
sung
on
pop
idol
for
example
and
by
whom
should
be
voted
the
best
song
of
the
past
thisisanumber
years
is
beyond
which
all
others
are
judged
then
musicians
may
as
well
give
highly
in
this
country
the
initial
list
was
very
weak
anyway
but
angels
the
best
song
of
the
last
thisisanumber
years
i
think
not
i
didnt
realize
radio
thisisanumber
had
so
many
listeners
under
the
age
of
thisisanumber
have
such
short
memories
a
great
song
yes
but
the
best
of
the
last
thisisanumber
years
not
a
to
the
song
has
been
voted
for
anything
by
the
smiths
in
particular
how
soon
is
now
or
anything
from
the
stone
roses
first
album
im
not
thisisanumber
i
like
robbie
and
angels
is
a
decent
best
song
of
the
past
thisisanumber
years
the
shortlist
wasnt
great
but
him
winning
it
is
a
jokepredictable
and
years
brits
reflects
poorly
on
the
state
of
british
music
over
the
last
thisisanumber
the
corporate
pulp
that
is
presneted
to
them
as
cutting
edge
music
and
true
talent
is
being
sadly
it
is
not
even
the
best
song
in
robbies
repertoire
never
mind
best
song
of
the
last
thisisanumber
and
love
that
lot
more
outstanding
songs
music
out
there
that
influenced
music
today
unfortunately
they
were
left
out
of
the
of
joy
division
a
band
who
through
two
albums
have
had
a
bigger
impact
on
music
and
continue
to
do
so
over
the
last
thisisanumber
years
than
robbie
williams
ever
anyone
with
more
emotion
and
snobby
stances
but
angels
has
hit
home
with
a
far
larger
audience
than
any
other
guys
have
played
an
influential
part
in
shaping
modern
day
music
while
angels
remains
yet
another
pop
in
thisisanumber
years
from
now
the
most
influential
artists
will
argue
that
robbie
williams
inspired
their
art
in
the
way
that
the
byrds
the
beatles
and
nick
drake
have
done
for
music
written
song
with
different
meanings
to
different
the
was
a
deserved
secondrate
record
has
beaten
such
a
line
up
of
amazing
songs
its
a
terrible
song
voted
for
by
the
masses
who
dont
have
the
brains
to
appreciate
innovative
and
exciting
thisisanumber
years
really
come
on
this
is
surely
a
joke
no
i
think
i
need
a
long
lie
the
british
public
do
not
have
a
clue
about
good
quality
music
when
they
pick
robbie
williams
over
the
beautifully
talented
kate
bush
and
joy
the
british
public
are
consistently
dull
ltno
offence
robbie
but
pleeease
there
must
be
a
thousand
better
songs
than
a
formulated
cheesy
pop
song
for
quite
frankly
it
is
an
embarassment
to
the
integrity
of
british
music
and
a
further
nail
in
the
coffini
think
robbie
deserves
it
he
has
been
the
most
iconic
of
any
stars
we
have
had
in
britain
since
john
lennon
and
is
an
idol
to
millions
it
is
jealous
of
his
but
hey
another
one
bites
the
dustobviously
all
the
karaoke
singers
in
the
uk
voted
for
of
the
last
thisisanumber
years
then
the
british
music
industry
is
in
excellent
material
but
this
is
not
the
best
the
type
of
music
i
normally
like
but
even
as
a
diehard
rock
fan
i
recognise
that
it
is
a
good
song
and
appelas
to
most
best
song
of
the
last
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
im
that
ticks
all
the
of
how
redundant
the
brit
awards
have
however
it
really
wasnt
up
against
any
other
proper
apart
from
kate
bush
the
other
choices
were
pathetic
also
why
werent
the
stones
there
david
bowie
etc
there
are
so
many
greater
songs
than
angelsi
wonder
if
it
was
simply
the
fact
that
robbie
wasnt
getting
more
awards
so
they
had
to
make
one
up
for
himbest
song
of
the
last
thisisanumber
years
what
a
ridiculuous
concept
and
an
even
more
ridiculous
wasnt
bohemian
rhapsody
for
which
we
should
all
be
song
but
i
really
dont
think
it
deserves
the
title
of
best
song
in
thisisanumber
yearsperhaps
the
vote
had
more
to
do
with
teenage
opinion
on
robbies
goodlooks
than
the
actual
song
dont
get
me
wrong
im
not
disputing
his
looks
but
there
are
more
deserved
had
angels
not
not
be
where
he
is
now
and
britain
would
have
been
deprived
of
one
of
its
most
charismatic
and
talented
performing
live
with
thisisanumber
people
singing
along
to
be
fully
that
angels
is
the
best
we
have
to
show
for
the
past
thisisanumber
years
im
rapidly
redifining
best
in
my
own
head
now
to
mean
most
gratuitously
played
at
weddings
and
funerals
because
people
think
it
has
deep
also
making
changes
doing
something
to
most
commercially
popularive
nothing
against
robbie
i
actually
like
his
music
but
how
can
this
possibly
be
the
best
song
from
the
last
thisisanumber
the
brits
has
proved
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
bargaining
tool
between
the
pop
moguls
to
boost
band
profiles
and
record
sisters
i
think
this
is
a
superb
record
and
thoroughly
deserves
the
newcomer
award
but
the
album
comes
no
where
near
thisisanumber
new
record
neither
are
they
in
the
same
baffling
discisions
made
they
are
not
for
artisic
reasons
but
for
by
the
general
in
musicpersonally
i
find
angels
by
robbie
williams
to
be
one
of
the
most
irritating
songs
i
have
ever
heardit
absolutely
deserved
to
united
the
generations
and
will
continue
to
be
played
for
many
years
to
of
the
original
thisisanumber
were
very
poor
choices
as
exercise
the
song
is
overplayed
and
choices
that
were
left
it
should
have
gone
to
either
joy
division
or
that
it
didnt
end
up
in
the
hands
of
will
young
is
no
way
it
deserved
to
rhapsody
nothing
compares
thisisanumber
u
i
think
that
anyone
with
the
slightest
musical
taste
will
realise
that
this
is
not
the
best
song
of
the
last
thisisanumber
record
company
manipulation
to
keep
an
artist
in
the
public
for
the
greatest
pair
of
trousers

thats
all
it

be

from

beat
dizzee
rascal
jamelia

and
the
streets
to
win
best
british
urban
act
at
the
brit
about
what
urban
music
word
in
this
country
and
america
to
describe
black
such
a
broad
range
of
black
music
that
its
from
innercity
music
and
what
people
are
doing
its
so
far
removed
that
i
dont
expect
them
to
get
it
bang
from
our
particular
genre
very
well
to
do
with
just
been
celebrated
by
joss
stone
winning
or
her
being
nominated
or
by
the
brits
acknowledging
that
theres
an
urban
music
scene
because
its
all
a
kick
in
the
teeth
at
the
end
of
the
thing
that
they
feel
comfortable
championing
because
of
what
she
looks
like
and
how
she
sounds
and
who
shes
signed
to
then
so
be
whats
really
going
are
a
number
of
core
elements
that
include
hiphop
rb
garage
and
into
that
obviously
comes
soul
brushstroke
that
is
the
umbrella
over
the
top
of
subgenres
and
there
are
offshoots
of
all
of
in
the
us
given
that
shes
a
uk
is
that
here
you
have
a
thisisanumber
from
devon
with
a
voice
to
die
for
and
a
bunch
of
really
really
good
tunes
and
she
looks
good
i
think
thats
whats
done
act
was
voted
for
by
viewers
of
mtv
a
worthy
definitely
comes
under
the
category
of
what
we
describe
as
is
the
interesting
thing
because
most
of
the
music
we
cover
is
made
in
large
cities
and
shes
literally
is
that
theres
a
big
root
with
black
music
or
dance
music
in
britain
i
think
thats
where
you
can
call
it
urban
thats
where
this
new
subcategory
or
ubercategory
has
come
enough
to
have
had
some
of
the
experiences
of
an
older
soul
singer
but
you
couldnt
argue
that
she
was
being
inauthentic
with
her
emotions
it
is
coming
from
somewhere
have
here
and
thats
the
only
way
by
which
we
judge
an
organisation
is
the
politically
correct
term
to
describe
music
which
originated
from
a
black
we
are
fighting
for
a
multicultural
britain
then
we
should
be
fighting
for
inclusion
rather
than
within
the
urban
music
community
i
think
acts
from
other
ethnicities
doing
classical
music
and
rock
should
be
accepted
everyone
is
out
yesterday
im
still
trying
to
find
out
what
people
of
other
races
received
any
sort
of
recognition
or
music
that
originates
from
a
city
and
typically
reflects
or
is
characteristic
of
urban
when
did
rb
become
the
hip
hop
tainted
thing
it
is
now
rb
stands
for
rhythm
and
blues
rememberthat
joss
stone
is
rubbish
is
award
for
urban
music
i
think
probably
should
include
hiphop
soul
funk
at
least
but
not
rock
or
pop
this
year
its
the
streets
although
dizzee
rascal
stakes
a
good
claimshe
definitely
deserved
to
win
a
prize
joss
stones
albums
are
quite
simply
amazing
easily
better
than
anything
else
that
was
released
last
urban
what
isnt
urban
is
completely
pointless
and
probably
fueled
by
urban
artists
who
werent
nominated
or
didnt
just
congratulate
her
for
the
talent
that
she
agree
with
the
comments
about
urban
use
hip
hop
and
rb
if
i
say
hip
hop
here
a
lot
of
people
have
no
idea
what
im
talking
by
any
other
name
urban
why
not
if
we
really
analysed
it
the
term
dance
music
is
misleading
because
it
doesnt
describe
everything
you
can
dance
urban
is
open
to
interpretation
it
strikes
me
as
simply
weird
that
joss
stone
has
hear
being
played
in
parties
in
the
inner
cities
i
live
in
brixton
and
have
never
heard
the
soul
sessions
pumping
out
of
of
a
bass
heavy
sound
system
in
any
parties
ive
been
celebrate
her
victory
lets
also
question
why
with
artists
so
successful
and
talented
as
jamelia
lemar
kanye
west
dizzee
rascal
alicia
keys
and
outkast
we
didnt
see
a
single
black
artist
on
stage
collecting
an
any
music
that
has
black
heritage
is
not
allowed
to
be
sung
by
anyone
who
isnt
shouldnt
be
acknowledged
for
it
even
if
theyre
pretty
dam
good
at
it
shes
thisisanumber
has
an
amazing
voice
and
lets
make
her
feel
real
bad
about
it
didnt
the
socalled
public
vote
on
this
onethis
idea
of
pigeonholing
whatever
is
popular
at
the
time
is
no
different
than
what
was
happening
in
the
thisisanumber
and
thisisanumber
in
relation
to
what
jazz
had
a
swinging
beat
syncopated
melody
or
soulful
feeling
jazz
much
to
the
chagrin
of
the
be
put
in
the
same
mould
as
bebop
cool
and
ragtime
all
very
different
styles
at
that
massively
misunderstood
in
truth
its
a
lazy
term
to
categorise
music
that
you
dont
really
musically
marvin
gaye
v
tuff
jam
but
no
doubt
have
their
speak
for
itself
and
not
judge
the
success
of
an
artist
by
the
number
of
awards
won
then
maybe
we
can
enjoy
the
music
for
what
it
is
rather
than
what
it
music
sucks
to
the
cities
its
way
better
out
known
as
urban
music
would
be
as
bad
as
excluding
lenny
kravitz
or
hendrix
from
rock
music
for
being
black
surely
i
dont
understand
the
point
that
ty
is
is
less
soulful
than
joss
work
won
he
might
have
said
be
urban
if
she
spent
most
of
her
life
in
the
devon
countryside
dont
care
what
her
branding
is
its
amazing
music
full
and
lets
just
call
it
music
and
lets
especially
drop
the
black
urban
tag
nearly
all
music
came
from
black
origin
this
just
sets
an
example
that
it
is
ok
to
pigeonhole
people
and
their
music
by
their
urban
music
category
is
simply
to
acknowledge
artists
that
are
making
what
is
historically
considered
urban
music
irrelevent
of
the
colour
of
their
skin
or
where
they
originate
certain
type
of
music
that
can
be
considered
urban
in
style
just
as
someone
from
an
inner
city
and
indeed
not
from
the
usa
could
sing
country
it
and
authentic
in
sound
would
we
criticise
it
being
referred
to
as
country
music
or
the
artist
for
representing
that
stylethe
term
urban
in
reference
to
a
music
genre
in
uk
has
developed
in
part
from
the
controversy
surrounding
the
branding
of
the
mobo
origin
has
confused
and
offended
many
existence
of
the
asian
music
black
or
white
in
relation
to
music
makes
people
feel
invoked
to
sidestep
the
debate
of
which
type
of
music
came
first
black
or
white
thereby
rendering
the
issue
new
debate
as
to
what
urban
also
new
term
altogether
to
describe
the
various
strains
of
soulrnb
and
hiphop
one
which
does
not
also
mean
something
else
as
we
have
done
with
come
about
recently
to
describe
black
music
thats
become
popular
or
common
use
five
of
six
years
industry
clumping
it
all
together
without
having
to
call
it
black
music
because
some
people
are
oversensitive
and
might
call
them
racist
for
been
called
urban
and
i
despise
the
to
any
neat
marketing
niche
because
thats
all
it
record
comapnies
tried
to
fracture
what
they
consider
music
of
black
origin
these
labels
have
been
used
to
undermine
the
status
of
good
music
into
a
unable
to
reach
young
people
without
condesending
they
simply
play
some
urban
music
on
the
soundtrack
as
if
its
some
dreadful
cheap
lift
it
is
just
i
agree
with
some
of
the
statements
at
least
the
statements
made
by
the
key
they
meaningless
northing
is
stone
would
have
been
that
successful
doing
the
music
she
was
doing
if
she
were
black
same
thing
with
streets
amy
winehouse
or
rhian
than
joss
stone
and
both
of
them
have
won
urban
music
awards
and
i
think
mobos
but
why
not
britsso
what
if
joss
stone
won
the
urban
surely
that
is
under
the
urban
banner
what
if
the
streets
had
won
would
people
be
whining
because
mike
skinner
is
the
fuss
is
about
race
where
the
real
issue
should
be
music
and
nothing
black
but
why
didnt
jamelia
or
lemar
get
a
brit
this
reminds
me
of
what
happened
to
craig
david
and
soul
ii
soul
in
the
past
getting
nominations
are
easy
to
get
but
picking
up
a
brit
seems
to
be
the
hardest
intelligent
comments
on
any
topic
these
have
said
it
there
is
music
you
like
and
music
you
dont
like
who
cares
what
label
you
put
on
itthat
entire
category
was
a
dizzee
rascal
up
against
joss
stone
its
like
putting
eminem
against
bob
best
british
r
b
award
for
her
talents
but
i
dont
think
it
was
very
urban
of
her
to
sing
angels
with
robbie
of
black
origin
well
doesnt
that
include
rock
music
made
in
the
inner
cities
well
almost
all
bands
end
up
making
music
in
londonmanchester
implication
that
all
black
people
live
in
cities
it
doesnt
make
any
put
into
a
genre
its
music
you
like
it
or
you
as
im
our
working
life
in
an
urban
environment
it
therefore
directly
shapes
what
we
write
name
for
all
styles
of
black
dont
know
as
the
name
is
characterise
the
urban
life
they
know
therefore
more
than
fit
the
term
urban
yet
as
theyre
a
white
rock
band
they
wont
be
described
as
and
great
timing
and
delivery
what
other
reason
do
they
need
to
award
her
the
brit
all
this
urban
and
other
such
categorisation
is
just
the
redtape
of
the
music
business
and
is
best
correct
and
probably
actually
racist

rejected

he
did
not

the

mr

thats
true
in

he
did
however
admit

have
partly
lost

been
too
slow
to
respond

of
the

it
was

that

zero
as

as

mr

also
called

of
breaking
