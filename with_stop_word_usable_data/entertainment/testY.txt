still
many
barriers

people

largely
focused

about

then
again
it
couldnt
be
better
than
the

could
itits
always
nice
to
see
these
old
toons
rereleased
but
after
the
abysmal
thunderbirds
movie
and
the
song
i
think
ive
been
completely
put
good
tend
to
look
more
and
more
into
the
past
to
things
that
make
them
feel
reason
retro
has
become
so
justice
to
the
original
then
all
it
can
do
is
create
a
wider
audience
and
possibly
entice
a
new
generation
of
persons
to
enjoy
and
revive
and
old
such
as
transformers
thundercats
and
that
we
all
have
very
fond
memories
of
in
the
first
place
the
thunderbirds
film
was
apalling
not
a
patch
on
the
puppet
series
i
grew
up
with
and
the
magic
roundabout
will
never
be
the
same
without
the
voice
of
eric
actors
and
thisisanumber
success
of
such
classics
as
the
magic
roundabout
was
that
the
characters
were
not
the
sweet
and
cuddly
creatures
that
you
would
the
animations
for
the
new
film
show
that
these
characteristics
have
not
been
of
this
sort
have
an
unfortunate
habit
of
disneyfying
everthing
and
they
just
lose
the
real
magic
that
made
the
show
special
in
the
first
not
least
of
which
because
i
look
like
him
and
would
like
to
see
someone
attempt
to
make
it
into
a
for
an
american
blockbuster
no
plot
and
no
tom
cruise
and
would
undoubtedly
have
a
girlfriend
or
remaking
these
classic
tv
shows
and
films
with
all
the
latest
technology
for
a
new
audience
but
for
me
a
lot
of
the
original
charm
is
lost
when
they
do
this
and
seems
more
like
a
money
making
exercise
to
cash
in
on
the
original
success
of
the
programme
than
reinventing
or
improving
who
have
never
seen
the
originals
they
can
watch
them
without
prejudice
but
to
people
who
have
grown
up
with
all
these
shows
such
as
thunderbirds
and
magic
roundabout
which
are
part
of
our
childhood
they
are
never
going
to
live
up
to
that
with
all
the
long
line
of
remakes
being
made
are
filmmakers
running
out
of
original
ideasall
i
can
say
is
bring
back
danger
mouse
probably
the
greatest
kids
show
realised
that
there
was
a
level
of
humour
shown
in
danger
mouse
that
was
completely
lost
on
me
when
i
was
a
cartoon
made
a
couple
of
years
nostalgia
programmes
the
animation
this
time
computer
created
flatcell
like
animation
failed
to
match
the
originals
cut
out
paper
technique
for
inventiveness
and
was
woefully
the
music
industry
has
been
pludering
past
decades
for
inspiration
clipping
sounds
from
thisisanumber
years
ago
is
much
cheaper
and
easier
that
doing
something
is
doing
the
same
now
its
just
cheaper
to
take
ideas
from
the
past
and
rework
them
rather
than
being
daring
and
trying
something
who
changes
in
a
fancy
dress
shop
steps
into
a
door
way
and
appears
in
another
time
and
place
would
be
amazing
if
they
got
a
decent
producer
and
writer
the
story
line
could
be
role
well
if
it
was
a
comedy
then
it
would
have
to
be
someone
like
steve
adventure
then
johnny
depp
playing
a
role
similar
to
the
pirates
of
the
caribbean
grannies
and
grandpas
go
to
the
cinema
as
well
you
knowwhy
cant
the
british
film
industry
try
making
gerry
andersons
ufo
or
captain
scarlet
or
saphire
and
steel
or
the
tomorrow
past
is
the
have
new
remakes
djs
are
sampling
or
reworking
thisisanumber
and
thisisanumber
ago
are
getting
modern
no
one
has
any
originality
any
more
why
not
just
leave
our
mistyeyed
nostalgia
the
episodes
the
lift
would
be
out
of
order
and
they
would
have
to
use
the
a
vicky
pollard
character
as
she
lives
in
a
high
rise
council
block
yeah
but
no
but
i
wasnt
even
thereid
like
to
see
title
costume
shop
imagination
in
todays
filmmakers
that
they
continually
try
to
remake
and
remodel
the
past
in
an
effort
to
cash
in
on
book
that
would
make
excellent
films
or
tv
programmes
why
not
use
them
instead
of
rehashing
the
dragons
made
but
unfortunately
the
film
that
it
was
made
into
didnt
come
up
to
be
remade
as
yet
is
thundercats
which
id
like
to
and
i
recently
went
through
a
period
of
buying
the
dvds
of
many
of
my
favourite
childrens
programs
for
my
thisisanumber
see
a
feature
length
version
of
noggin
the
nog
appear
on
the
big
screen
very
be
left
well
alone
and
i
will
not
be
surprised
if
the
magic
roundabout
does
not
do
well
at
the
box
office
especially
since
it
will
be
going
up
against
the
spongebob
squarepants
movie
popular
among
children
because
its
original
witty
and
to
the
children
of
today
as
it
did
all
those
many
years
the
wheelies
rentaghost
terrahawks
bodoh
the
list
could
go
on
and
onif
a
transformers
movie
is
indeed
on
the
cards
then
ill
be
the
first
one
on
amazon
buying
a
copy
eagerly
waiting
at
the
front
door
with
a
frothy
mouth
and
a
nervous
to
me
at
an
extortionate
price
i
dont
care
till
then
ill
have
to
make
do
with
the
citreon
thisisanumber
wisp
on
the
big
screen
but
sadly
without
the
late
kenneth
williams
doing
the
voices
it
wouldnt
be
the
by
the
late
willie
rushden
superb
childrens
a
big
screen
movie
or
even
jamie
and
the
magic
torchhmmmmm
i
could
go
on
and
my
the
best
childrens
the
big
screen
is
that
noone
could
approach
oliver
postgates
wonderful
are
of
their
time
and
the
methods
used
are
an
integral
part
of
the
by
using
cgi
in
a
remake
of
the
bearded
hippy
yoffi
could
take
on
a
whole
new
level
with
a
more
lifelike
fingermousebob
the

in

of

the
women
they

the
evil
clowns
krusty
and
fail
miserably
find
out
this
would
love
to
see
made
into
a
live
action
movie
is
joe
of
admission
alone
to
see
the
large
screen
version
of
joes
a
rich
seam
of
material
worthy
of
bigscreen
bigbudget
movie
was
targetted
as
a
childrent
movie
that
really
let
it
those
shows
with
such
affection
are
now
the
parents
of
children
were
children
when
these
programmes
were
first
shown
have
grown
up
and
are
plundering
their
childhoods
isnt
it
id
hate
to
see
bagpuss
with
perfect
animation
i
love
that
done
in
a
shed
clunkiness
and
you
couldnt
recreate
the
in
a
look
around
you
mockauthentic
style
i
might
be
and
his
magic
torch
that
would
be
megathis
regurgitation
of
old
films
and
tv
shows
makes
me
angry
it
is
corporate
laziness
resting
on
the
safety
of
other
peoples
ideas
because
it
guarantees
to
bring
in
modern
day
pop
bands
who
release
other
peoples
material
will
young
big
bucks
in
the
forgotten
in
thisisanumber
months
time
is
irrelevant
saturated
with
this
mindless
drivel
but
it
can
only
be
stopped
if
people
stop
buying
iti
pray
they
never
do
a
remake
of
chorlton
and
the
the
series
from
when
it
was
on
tv
but
have
the
set
on
dvd
and
its
a
from
the
fact
that
there
were
very
few
special
effects
involved
and
compared
to
todays
stuff
it
looks
innocent
like
chorlton
himself
and
it
would
be
a
real
shame
if
they
did
remake
glamour
to
london
on
saturday
for
the
biggest
night
in
the
british
film
gere
were
just
some
of
the
actors
who
attended
the

to
an
uncertain
british
climate
that
threatened

one

its
vital
that
keep
up
our
efforts
in

be
wild
about
the
oscars
but
cinemagoers
and
the
tvviewing
public
are
sick
of
watching
award
ceremonies
according
to
some
la
film
news
thinks
there
are
just
too
many
televised
gatherings
of
stars
showering
praise
on
each
but
unprintable
description
for
these
glitzy
events
which
roughly
translates
a
celebrity
host
and
comedian
chris
rock
who
whipped
up
a
media
storm
for
saying
he
rarely
watched
them
calling
award
shows
about
celebrity
and
fashion
mr
strauss
to
be
a
ratings
loser
and
it
seems
oscars
organisers
are
determined
not
to
go
the
same
include
lining
up
all
five
nominees
on
stage
before
announcing
the
the
changes
were
aimed
at
boosting
flagging
advertising
the
oscars
only
generated
excitement
outside
the
industry
when
a
blockbuster
such
as
titanic
or
lord
of
the
rings
was
film
awards
representing
directors
actors
and
producers
guilds
also
means
few
surprises
are
left
by
the
time
the
oscar
ceremony
is
upon
us
he
angeles
times
and
los

daily
news
bears
this
out
speculation
about
who
will
win
seems
to
have
ground
to
a
a

going

to
protect
the

firmly

bets
have
closed

category
with
ray
star
jamie
foxx
a
dead
cert
to
thinks
thisisanumber
films
have
simply
not
grabbed
the
publics
adore
this
year
he
example
people
loved
it
and
it
made
a
ton
of
to
thisisanumber
there
was
a
realisation
in
america
that
things
might
not
be
so
rosy
after
darker
films
such
as
million
dollar
baby
aviator
and
finding
neverland
which
end
with
casualty
as
to
whether
rock
could
pep
up
the
awards
the
critics
were
not
make
an
impact
but
added
im
all
for
lower
ratings
though
there
are
far
more
important
things
going
on
than
the
oscars
mr
karger
said
the
comic
might
boost
younger
viewers
but
mike
goodridge
thought
rocks
humour
could
prompt
americas
conservative
states
to
switch
critics
have
any
views
on
who
would
winclint
eastwoods
million
dollar
baby
affected
people
emotionally
which
is
why
it
will
beat
aviator
which
was
about
technical
artistry
not
feelings
mr
karger
added
mr
hearts
not
their
heads
and
mr
goodridge
said
best
film
and
director
were
between
martin

from
the

uk
film
they
would
personally
prefer
to
