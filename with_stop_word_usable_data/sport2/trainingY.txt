may
be

sooner

there
is
no
shortterm
prospect
of

being

and
it
set
back
her

by
about
two
months
but
that
has
been
solved
and
we

push
ahead
now
he
get
fit
as
an

then
we

an
introduction
back
to
the
competitive
arena
moore
said
he
is
confident
hansen
can
make

get
mcilroys
career
back

not
always
matched
his
promise
with
performances
but
believes
his
decision
to
change
coaches
and
move
base
will
bring
the
feels
his

has
been
transformed
by
the
nononsense
leadership
style
of
former
army
sergeant
work
with
thisisanumber
runners
roger
black
and
mark
richardson
in
the
past
but
under
his
guidance
mcilroy
has
secured
five
wins
this
indoor
his
best
shape
since
finishing
fourth
for
ireland
at
the
outdoor

mcilroy
who
temporarily
retired
last
august
before
returning
to
the

under
lesters
shrewd
to
climb
mount
everest
and
i
now
know
you
cant
do
it
on
your
standing
halfdead
and
terrified
on
the
starting
line
which
became
a
bit
too
much
mcilroy
who
was
compared
to
the
likes
of
sebastian
coe
steve
cram
and
steve
ovett
in
his
younger
days
is
now
competing
without
the
benefit
of
national
lottery
maintains
his
current
form
and
repeats
the
worldclass
times
he
produced
in
the
thisisanumber
and
thisisanumber
at
major
races
in
erfurt
and
stuttgart
earlier
this

and
then
claimed
the
european

race
would
be
between
himself
dutchman
arnoud
okken
and

mcilroy

in
his

fair
enough
everyone
has
the
right
to
their
own
lets
face
it
i
havent

him
to

on

is
also
already
looking

this

about

having

were
plenty

of
kelly

and
paula
of
a
few
more
events
that
made
thisisanumber
another
year
to
remember
or
forget
for
was
kellys
success
in
the
to
her
success
because
if
she
won
that
then
the
thisisanumber
would
be
a
bit
of
a
i
shouldnt
i
thoughts
about
going
for
the
double
in
the
thisisanumber
its
your
best
event
it
was
such
good
fun
to
commentate
on
her
thisisanumber
and
it
was
nice
to
be
able
to
be
part
of
her
athens
thisisanumber
relay
team
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
but
a
great
climax
to
the
jason
gardener
darren
campbell
marlon
devonish
and
mark
lewisfrancis
knew
deep
down
that
it
was
their
best
chance
of
a
the
individual
sprints
so
maybe
they
did
lift
their
game
when
they
knew
something
was
really
at
a
much
bigger
achievement
than
kellys
on
a
global
for
thisisanumber
years
to
win
both
the
thisisanumber
and
thisisanumber
the
thisisanumber
crown
and
i
had
finished
commentating
i
jumped
up
ran
down
the
stairs
pushed
everyone
out
the
way
and
just
gave
him
a
big
african
runners
who
has
embraced
the
tradition
of
the
mile
and
he
loves
to
hear
all
the
roger
bannister
a
bit
of
time
with
even
though
my
french
and
his
english
are
not
very
this
year
is
the
obvious
low
on
a
personal
level
and
for
the
expectations
of
the
nation
as
around
athens
that
conspired
to
produce
a
very
dramatic
ending
which
i
think
has
been
greatly
the
right
thing
to
do
but
starting
in
the
thisisanumber
five
days
later
was
not
her
head
things
going
wrong
in
her
preparation
and
on
the
able
to
do
all
her
running
sessions
and
feeling
the
pressure
of
the
race
looming
ahead
of
start
line
in
athens
physically
and
emotionally
doesnt
feel
right
when
you
are
preparing
to
race
a
marathon
thisisanumber
miles
down
the
road
it
will
hit
you
like
a
brick
paulas
olympics
it
that
she
will
have
learned
a
lot
from
it
and
so
will
a
lot
of
people
including
in
the
new
york
marathon
has
to
go
down
as
one
of
the
most
and
kenyas
susan
chepkemei
and
you
dont
usually
get
that
kind
of
excitement
in
for
all
athletics
fans
because
to
use
one
of
my
favourite
words
paula
showed
real
a
rarity
for
me
too
because
i
genuinely
did
not
have
an
inkling
how
the
race
was
going
to
pan
papered
over
the
cracks
in
the
general
performance
of
the
british
not
producing
enough
people
who
are
capable
of
reaching
finals
at
senior
the
track
was
michael
east
in
the
and
wonder
where
are
the
new
breed
and
thats
where
things
begin
to
look
even
gloomier
for
british
athletics
as
we
did
not
win
any
medals
at
the
world
junior
championships
in
thisisanumber
and
she
was
the
highest
finisher
for
team
have
athletes
getting
into
the
finals
at
junior
level
then
it
really
doesnt
look
good
for
the
beijing
olympics
and
enjoyed
this
year
benita
johnson
winning
the
world
cross
country
championships
back
in

to
think
of
the
event
as
something
of
an
african
up
and
deliver
such
a
surprise
was
something
with
all
the
drug
scandals
especially
would
come
to
a
head
so
we
can
move
when
drugs
cheats
are
caught
because
it
shows
the
sport
is
standing
up
to
it
and
not
turning
a
blind
eye
to
come
out
of
balco

katerina

well
suspicions
have
been
hanging
over

that

however
linford

countered
its
easy
to
criticise
when
you
havent
gone
through
the
system
here
johnson
was
involved
in
a
verbal
spat
with
britains
darren
campbell
earlier
this

claims
he
had
torn
a

in
the
wake
of
his
failure
to
reach

and
thisisanumber
of
aspects
of
british
sprinters
getting
upset
or
riled
is
when
there
is
a
debate
as
to
which
one
is
better
than
the
other
he
outside
the
being
the
best
in
the
world
and
not
just
on
being
the
top
british
sprinter
speaking
at
an
elite
coaches
conference
in
birmingham
johnson
also
argued
that
although
there
has
been
more
investment
in
the
sport
in
britain
it
had
not
necessarily
reaped
the
he
that
of
some
us
athletes
who
have
no
hungrier
and
more
motivated
because
their
road
to
success
is
a
lot
more
difficult
and
top
they
are
more
of
the
greatest
marathons
of
paulas
it
was
the
toughest
race
shes
ever
taken
part
marathon
doesnt
make
up
for
the
disappointment
of
athens
in
any
shape
or
form
but
it
will
offer
hope
and
reassurance
for
next
year
had
been
athens
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
to
look
forward
with
any
under
this
year
and
make
plans
about
her
there
would
have
been
a
lot
of
positives
to
take
out
of
if
she
needs
a
number
of
the
girls
going
into
the
race
with
expectations
of
wasnt
one
of
paulas
best
times
it
wasnt
far
off
the
record
on
a
difficult
the
leadup
to
this
race
and
she
said
that
in
many
ways
she
was
facing
a
nowin
people
would
say
why
couldnt
she
do
that
in
athens
and
if
she
lost
people
would
say
her
career
was
wondering
what
would
happen
if
paula
was
forced
to
drop
out
of
this
race
as
she
did
in
the
marathon
and
thisisanumber
in
she
would
have
kept
pull
out
in
athens
the
niggling
injuries
her
lack
of
energy
and
the
oppressive
conditions
werent
at
play
she
could
finish
the
hype
in
the
media
ahead
of
this

were

she
will
attempt
to
erase
the
double
disappointment
of

athens
olympics
where
she
failed
to
finish

and
then
the
radcliffe
ahead
of

largely
upon

of

she

to
have
a
ticklist
of
personal
as
completing

she
is
still
enjoying

richards
says
she
must

ahead
the
thisisanumber
has
repeatedly
chosen
to
tick
the
dont
know
this
weekends
european
indoor
championships
where
she
was
selected
for
both
the
thisisanumber
and
thisisanumber
because
of
a
hamstring
the
olympic
champion
over
both
those
distances
decides
she
just
does
not
feel
like
racing
anymore
well
its
a
lot
easier
being
the
double
olympic
champion
being
feted
by
everybody
than
training
to
be
at
the
top
in
middle
distance
running
points
out
former
olympian
and
bbc
pundit
steve
strong
desire
to
carry
on
doing
it
even
if
youre
very
talentedholmes
drive
and
determination
have
always
been
unquestionable
that
is
the
reason
she
has
battled
back
from
a
string
of
injuries
that
threatened
to
see
her
finish
her
career
the
kent
athlete
begins
questioning
desire
and
energy
to
go
through
a
major
championship
holmes
asked
in
the
new
at
thisisanumber
holmes
will
also
be
aware
that
time
is
running
johnson
a
fivetime
olympic
gold
medallist
retired
shortly
after
his
thisisanumber
birthday
as
did
britains
double
olympic
champion
decathlete
daley
grind
will
only
get
harder
for
holmes
who
has
already
admitted
she
doesnt
like
the
training
anymore
whilst
out
on
the
circuit
the
allure
of
defeating
a
double
olympic
champion
will
spur
her
opponents
suffer
the
indignity
of
being
a
strong
chance
of
winning
any
race
she
will
not
step
onto
the
the
form
that
fuelled
her
ambitions
last
summer
there
are
more
prizes
up
for
in
athens
the
thisisanumber
revealed
she
would
still
like
to
win
her
first
indoors
in
madrid
before
she
goes
on
to
prepare
for
the
outdoor
season
where
there
are
still
scores
to
be
settled
such
as
a
first
gold
at
the
world
championships
in
which
could
gnaw
away
at
holmes
motivation
the
realisation
that
no
matter
how
hard
she
trains
nothing
she
wins
now
can
surpass
her
achievements
in
achievements
cannot
be
matched
shouldnt
they
be
at
least
shared
and
celebrated
you
dont
get
the
chance
very
often
in
your
career
to
step
onto
the
track
as
the
double
olympic
champion
agreed
take
your
bow
in
front
of
the
fans
because
its
a
fantastic
to
run
races
on
the
circuits
but
whether
or
not
she
runs
in
the
major
championships
is
much
less
certainathletics
fans
had
every
reason
to
believe
they
would
see
the
newlook
kelly
holmes
tearing
up
the
track
denied
she
planned
to
heels
about
making
a
decision
on
where
when
or
whether
to
even
bother
competing
again
thats
just
kelly
explains
what
she
is
going
to
do
a
pronouncement
now
its
headline
herself
what
it
is
she
wants
and
that
will
be
based
on
athletics
decisions
whether
she
can
be
competitive
if
she
is
fit
enough
to
put
her
neck
on
the
run
again
noone
is
going
to
turn
round
and
say
youre
making
the
wrong
to
the
line
to
narrowly
claim
the
mens
thisisanumber
title
at
the
norwich
union
indoor
trials
and
aaas
to
a
rolling
start
and
had
to
dig
deep
to
dip
ahead
of
mark
findlay
and
darren
chin
who
both
set
personal
my
experience
told
in
me
and
i
believe
i
can
go
faster
gardeners
performance
in
sheffield
could
have
been
affected
by
the
news
which
he
heard
before
his
semifinal
that
his
european
record
had
been
broken
frenchman
ronald
pognon
who
will
be
a
real
threat
at
the
european
championships
set
a
new
time
of
thisisanumber
onehundreth
of
a
second
faster
than
gardeners
previous
the
womens
thisisanumber
title
in
thisisanumber
i
feel
there
is
a
lot
more
to
come
along
said
the
second
and
dip
under
the
european
qualifying
out
of
the
final
with
a
chest
stormed
to
the
womens
thisisanumber
hurdles
record
for
the
second
time
in
seven
days
clocking
thisisanumber
seconds
to
finish
ahead
of
rival
diane
told
bbc
and
im
getting
recognition
claxtons
time
was
also
good
enough
to
qualify
for
the
european
in
sheffield
asdominated
the
race
from
start
to
at
a
startling
pace
but
had
to
hold
off
the
challenge
of
welshman
jimmy
watkins
over
the
final
thisisanumber
to
win
in
one
minute
thisisanumber
a
lifetime
best
of
thisisanumber
had
already
booked
their
places
in
madrid
and
were
again
well
within
the
qualifying
go
through
all
the
gears
before
the
europeans
and
i
wont
run
again
until
then
said
in
the
womens
race
as
she
crossed
the
line
to
win
in
useful
weekend
with
two
more
personal
bests
in
high
jump
and
clocked
thisisanumber
in
the
heats
of
the
thisisanumber
pressure
but
if
i
dont
perform
then
its
not
the
end
of
the
world
pole
vaultermade
a
winning
return
to

competition
after
a

a
twoyear
ban
after
testing

for
anabolic
steroids
clinched
the
title
with
a
championship
record
in
the
mens
triple
jump
title
in
in
australia
over
the
winter
landed
thisisanumber
with
his
final
effort
the
longest
leap
in
the
world
this
i
just
wanted
the
qualifying
and
hopefully
ill
come
back
from
madrid
with
a
gold
medal
nathan
douglas
continued
his
steady
progress
this
season
as
he
set
a
lifetime
best
of
thisisanumber
in
second
while
jonathan
moore
took
jump
competition
both
achieving
the
european
best
of
thisisanumber
on
his
very
first
jump
and
then
promptly
retired
with
a
bruised
up
with
his
six
jumps
but
had
to
settle
for
a
seasons
best
jump
of
by
my
doctor
and
so
im
pleased
to
come
here
and
get
the
qualifying
mark
said
front
runner
catherine
murphy
in
the
final
thisisanumber
to
steal
the
womens
thisisanumber
of
thisisanumber
seconds
to
win
her
first
indoor
the
qualifying
mark
something
murphy
already
ahead
of
promising
channel
islands
decathlete
dale
seeking
british
citizenship
showed
his
raw
talent
as
he
burst
through
in
for
the
european
championships
and
claim
the
aaas
title
in
the
womens
high
new
personal
best
of
seven
minutes
thisisanumber
seconds
to
defend
his
aaas
title
in
thisisanumber
years
the
eightminute
barrier
has
been
broken
at
the
championships
and
was
just
within
the
european
in
the
absence
of
kelly
good
enough
to
qualify
for
madrid
but
ovens
had
already
opted
out
of
the
who
had
to
fight
off
a
closing
pack
to
claim
the
title
in
told
us
well
i
think
we
could
be
heading
to
the
european
championships
with
half
a
dozen
medal
beginning
to
make
steps
forward
to
see
a
few
new
faces
and
there
were
lots
of
personal
bests
kicking
for
me
was
sarah
claxtons
win
in
the
thisisanumber
week
puts
her
right
up
there
and
if
she
repeats
that
in
madrid
she
will
be
close
to
picking
up
a
performance
was
that
she
was
under
pressure
to
produce
the
goods
when
it
hurdler
for
some
time
now
and
i
think
she
was
surprised
to
be
beaten
by
better
of
diane
in
a
headtohead
race
will
give
sarah
allan
scott
was
right
in
there
and
there
is
definitely
more
to
come
from
is
so
strong
i
think
the
selectors
will
pick
three
hurdlers
to
go
to
events
not
only
with
his
hair
but
also
with
his
leap
of
thisisanumber
which
puts
him
at
the
top
of
the
world
before
the
competition
and
he
was
really
looking
forward
to
getting
out
shape
and
has
some
big
jumps
inside
him
but
then
phillips
always
the
runway
was
not
very
helpful
so
for
phillips
to
jump
like
that
is
a
good
but
just
needs
some
consistency
and
if
he
does
that
then
the
big
jumps
will
get
even
sotherton
had
a
great
weekend
and
continued
to
show
she
is
in
the
long
jump
high
jump
and
thisisanumber
hurdles
and
you
cant
ask
for
more
than
kluft
in
the
pentathlon
at
the
european
championships
but
she
has
every
chance
of
a
medal
on
the
basis
of
what
weve
seen
so
where
different
people
help
her
with
different
disciplines
but
it
seems
to
be
working
really
were
disappointing
in
different
he
wasnt
at
his
he
knows
it
was
an
offday
for
and
the
other
lads
nearly
got
a
big
scalp
out
was
hoping
to
run
against
defending
champion
joice
of
rivalry
but
joice
had
to
pull
out
with
a
chest
i
think
jeanette
would
have
gone
a
bit
pole
vault
on
her
return
following
a
twoyear
drugs
the
wider
view
is
that
she
is
our
best
pole
vaulter
by
a
long
way
and
that
shouldnt
be
the
since
janine
has
been
away
and
if
there
was
more
domestic
competition
i
think
that
would
help
to
look
out
for
are
the
citizenship
issues
surrounding
mark
findlay
and
rabah
chosen
to
represent
trinidad
and
tobago
but
has
never
run
for
them
so
he
could
still
compete
for
great
thisisanumber

from
the
sudan

is
trying
to
gain

late
challenge
from

jimmy
watkins
in
the
final
thisisanumber
go
through
all
the

before

and
i
wont
run
again
until
then
said
id
get
close
to
the
british
record
but
i
blew
up
in
the
end
mcilroy

which
she
set
in

in

by
one

only
the

that
takes
place
a
day
after

london
is
very
special
to
me
said
things
like
heart
i
really
want
to
course
and
know
it
will
always
be
a
great
quality
this
year
which
adds
to
the
mixed
emotions
in
thisisanumber
as
stunning
victories
went
handinhand
with
disappointing
defeats
and
more
drugs
by
storming
to
double
gold
on
the
track
at
the
olympic
over
team
gb
after
their
biggest
medal
hope
paula
radcliffe
dropped
out
of
the
marathon
and
then
the
did
their
bit
by
taking
a
shock
disappointing
style
falling
over
in
the
final
of
thisisanumber
at
the
world
indoor
championships
where
she
was
self
doubt
but
that
proved
unfounded
as
she
overhauled
rival
maria
mutola
to
win
the
thisisanumber
her
first
global
made
it
double
gold
in
the
thisisanumber
years
a
briton

achieved
the
olympic
middledistance
star
of
team
gb
it
was
radcliffe
who
carried
expectations
before
the
august
went
into
the
athens
event
as
favourite
but
an
exhausted
radcliffe
dropped
out
after
thisisanumber
miles
in
five
days
later
also
backfired
as
she
again
pulled
out
with
eight
laps
trauma
behind
her
with
a
thrilling
win
in
novembers
new
york
glory
for
the
british
mens
olympic
squad
after
a
poor
start
to
the
be
the
first

where
the

would
fail
to
win
a

with
michael
east
the

just
like

finally
lived
up
to
his
promise
in

in

relay
in
athens
to
take
top
honours
for
team
yet
to
build
on
his
world
junior
championship
win
four
years
made
me
realise
that
i
can
get
to
the
top
level
and
i
want
to
get
there
why
not
he
events
will
feature
in
his
buildup
to
the
worlds
with
one
the
norwich
union
grand
prix
in
birmingham
on
thisisanumber
february
where
he
will
take
on
another
member
of
britains
victorious
mens
relay
team
jason
gardener
over
early
to
make
any
predictions
for
helsinki
but
i
have
my
eyes
open
and
i
know
i
can
be
the
best
in
the
both
the
thisisanumber
and
thisisanumber
at
next
months
european
indoor
championships
despite
not
yet
confirming
her
about
whether
to
compete
in
her
first
european
indoors
in
believes
it
is
likely
holmes
will
isnt
it
shes
gone
back
to
one
if
holmes
does
take
her
place
in
the
gb
side
she
has
already
indicated
that
thisisanumber
will
be
her
favoured
have
to
decide
until
thisisanumber
hours
before
the
event
begins
in
madrid
on
thisisanumber
her
run
in
birmingham
at
last
weekends
grand
will
goes
and
she
will
have
to
be
close
to
top
form
and
he
admitted
holmes
presence
would
be
a
great
boost
to
the
rest
of
the
norwich
union
gb
member
and
is
very
good
to
have
there
he
the
rest
of
the
great
britain
team
announced
on
included
and
will
be
chasing
his
third
successive
gold
event
by
mark
lewisfrancis
runnerup
behind
him
three
years
ago
in
vienna
and
new
boy
darren
championship
organisers
to
compete
against
carolina
kluft
in
the
heptathlon
in
athens
where
the
swede
took
level
of
competition
in
gbs
thisisanumber
to
be
attended
by
jones
before
he
retires
to
be
succeeded
by
dave
the
overwhelming
target
for
uka
and
therefore
it
is
beneficial
to
start
the
next
fouryear
cycle
with
a
notsopressurised
major
a
chance
for
the
young
and
inexperienced
to
make
a
name
for
themselves
and
the
current
indoor
season
has
produced
some
exciting
new
on
a
long
journey
to
beijing
and
the
thisisanumber
olympics
but
for
some
of
the
emerging

this
will

from

with
the
very
last
jump
of

to
better
johnsons
mark
of
thisisanumber
her
second
personal
best
inside
a
didnt
think
id
end
up
with
second
place
said
johnson
who
wore
londons
thisisanumber
olympic
bid
slogan
back
the
bid
on
her
get
a
bit
better
for
the
medalwon
the
mens
event
with
a
seasons
best
of
thisisanumber
taking
the
scalp
of
world
indoor
champion
savante
stringfellow
of
the
world
pole
vault
record
but
her
achievement
could
not
hide
the
fact
it
was
not
the
best
meet
we
have
ever
seen
in
meets
that
go
by
without
the
russian
breaking
a
world
in
training
and
i
would
just
love
her
to
put
us
out
of
our
misery
and
have
a
go
at
it
rather
than
extending
the
indoor
record
by
one
centimetre
at
a
pushing
the
barriers
and
being
the
best
you
can
and
i
would
like
to
see
her
have
a
go
at
thisisanumber
in
the
record
she
gets
thisisanumber
so
she
can
afford
to
be
deliberate
about
was
a
very
encouraging
evenings
work
for
kelly
in
very
good
shape
and
is
in
the
worlds
top
three
thisisanumber
runners
this
but
there
was
no
coming
back
over
the
last
thisisanumber
as
kelly
dominated
the
race
so
beating
samaria
is
a
bit
of
a
benchmark
for
would
like
to
run
in
the
european
indoor
championships
but
she
just
hasnt
convinced
herself
she
is
fit
enough
to
do
jason
gardener
is
struggling
to
come
near
what
is
going
to
be
required
to
win
the
mens
thisisanumber
in
but
still
could
not
stay
with
the
indoors
but
for
some
reason
he
is
struggling
to
maintain
his
pace
through
to
the
see
what
mark
lewisfrancis
could
have
done
in
the
final
if
only
he
hadnt
got
himself
game
to
his
advantage
but
it
tripped
him
up
and
made
him
look
a
bit
go
when
the
gun
goes
and
not
your
rivals
by
employing
the
falsestart
tactic
you
have
to
remember
not
to
false
start
yourself
in
much
better
mark
or
jason
yet
which
suggests
frances
ronald
pognon
who
has
run
thisisanumber
seconds
will
be
under
threat
at
the
sarah
claxtons
victory
in
the
thisisanumber
hurdles
was
the
best
thing
to
come
out
of
the
was
melanie
purkiss
winning
the
womens
national
thisisanumber
race
in
a
new
personal
best
of
thisisanumber
in
another
lifetime
best
so
we
have
a
very
strong
thisisanumber
squad
going
to
the
european
to
run
too
so
we
have
a
real
prospect
of
a
meseret
defar
was
disappointing
in
the
thisisanumber
but
i
dont
think
the
pacemaking
was
early
pace
but
could
not
maintain
it
and
if
jo
pavey
had
been
in
last
years
shape
she
would
have
given
defar
a
real
run
for
her
could
not
hang
in
more
from
bernard
lagat
in
the
mens
over
from
the
usa
so
he
may
not
be
that
sharp
and
i
still
think
he
is
in
great
well
beaten
by
markos
for
bekele
as
he
has
been
struggling
this
national
indoor
arena
and
i
felt
uncomfortable
in
the
commentary
distance
runners
and
in
fact
defar
complained
to
her
coach
after
the
race
that
she
could
not
get
her
breath
his
schedule
to
ensure
he
is
fully
fit
for
the
european
indoor
and
has
pulled
out
of
international
meets
in
madrid
and
lievin
this
week
as
well
as
warmweather
training
in
peter
abdomen
at
the
birmingham
meeting
but
is
back
in
full
training
sprinter
mark
lewisfrancis
will
also
not
compete
in
madrid
on
seasons
best
of
thisisanumber
seconds
over
thisisanumber
in
birmingham
last
week
also
prefers
to
focus
his
attentions
on
next
months
european
indoor
teammate
jason
gardener
at
the
europeans
three
years
ago
will
continue
his
training
at
this
first
major
medal
and
this
season
he
has
shown
he
could
be
in
the
sort
of
form
to
grab
a
spot
on
the
podium
in
best
of
thisisanumber
at
the
birmingham
grand
prix
good
enough
to
push
world
indoor
champion
savante
stringfellow
into
last
week
in
my
role
as
an
ambassador
to
londons
thisisanumber
olympic
all
my
marathon
capitals
bid
team
think
im
mad
to
be
taking
part
in
the
london
he
would
never
dream
of
running
a
marathon
even
though
he
was
an
olympic
middledistance
and
former
sprinter
frankie
fredericks
who
is
now
an
ioc
member
all
wanted
to
know
why
anyone
would
want
to
run
that
who
have
been
running
for
most
of
their
lives
wouldnt
think
it
would
be
that
positive
about
my
intentions
was
tanni
grey
thompson
who
has
won
the
london
marathon
wheelchair
race
six
busy
week
entertaining
the
international
olympic
committees
ioc
evaluation
commission
i
actually
found
my
running
schedule
easier
to
distracted
by
all
sorts
of
things
but
for
the
five
days
i
was
in
london
i
was
in
a
pressurised
situation
but
i
found
it
easy
to
relax
by
ioc
team
did
not
finish
until
the
early
evening
so
i
just
managed
to
squeeze
in
a
thisisanumber
thursday
because
we
had
to
visit
all
the
olympic
sites
around
london
that
was
pretty
shattering
but
when
we
got
back
to
the
hotel
i
got
back
on
the
to
the
special
dinner
at
buckingham
palace
which
was
a
nice
especially
when
im
day
i
didnt
have
to
feel
bad
about
missing
my
training
quick
run
on
saturday
ahead
of
the
final
ioc
presentations
before
heading
home
for
my
daughters
did
all
of
my
runs
on
the
treadmill
which
isnt
the
same
as
exercising
from
australia
ran
alongside
me
one
and
that
made
the
time
go
past
more
running
in
the
gym
because
there
is
more
running
on
the
road
you
need
your
body
to
get
used
to
that
jarring
feeling
when
your
feet
hit
the
on
the
road
for
my
long
run
on
was
a
bit
concerned
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
complete
well
and
even
though
it
was
bitterly
cold
i
put
in
thisisanumber
miles
only
another
thisisanumber
to
go
the
proceeds
from
his
london

mr

he
understands
what
he
did
and
should
be
given
a
chance
once
matteroffact
way
as
he
recalls
the
car
accident
which
occurred
nine
days
before
he
was
scheduled
to
step
out
into
the
olympic
stadium
in
athens
for
the
thisisanumber
he
talks
of
his
immediate
thoughts
after
a
lorry
driving
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
had
ploughed
into
his
rental
pain
and
i
guessed
that
one
of
my
toes
was
broken
says
the
waterford
a
cortisone
injection
you
never
though
all
the
muscles
had
been
ripped
off
my
pelvis
but
i
was
thinking
maybe
we
could
do
something
with
laser
therapy
and
ultra
sound
and
hopefully
id
be
able
to
race
it
took
over
thisisanumber
hours
before
jamie
knew
with
certainty
that
he
would
not
be
competing
in
his
second
two
places
and
with
one
of
my
vertebrae
the
bottom
part
had
exploded
so
im
fierce
lucky
not
be
well
which
was
on
the
brake
jamie
didnt
finally
arrive
at
hospital
in
athens
until
some
nine
and
a
half
hours
after
the
had
no
pain
killers
which
was
ridiculous
in
thisisanumber
degrees
and
saw
them
it
was
a
case
of
moving
on
and
thinkingok
ive
got
a
different
set
of
circumstances
now
within
three
days
he
was
arriving
back
in
ireland
by
air
operate
on
jamies
back
immediately
but
he
insisted
on
delaying
any
surgery
until
he
arrived
back
home
something
he
is
now
very
relieved
put
three
or
four
inch
titanium
rods
either
side
of
my
spinal
cord
up
through
my
lower
back
and
i
would
never
have
been
able
to
race
of
pressure
on
me
to
agree
to
the
mater
in
dublin
they
said
it
was
possible
for
it
to
heal
totally
naturally
which
is
giving
me
the
chance
to
get
back
into
competition
which
is
very
important
to
been
absolutely
fantastic
jamie
had
to
wear
a
body
cast
for
three
and
a
half
months
after
the
accident
and
spent
most
of
that
time
flat
on
his
six
weeks
until
he
was
finally
able
to
walk
unaided
on
thisisanumber
something
finally
really
measurable
in
terms
of
my
recovery
physio
sessions
with
johnston
mcevoy
in
limerick
have
been
a
vital
part
of
his
acupuncture
and
its
very
to
my
needle
went
in
yesterday
and
im
fairly
incapacitated
today
as
a
result
jamie
has
also
travelled
to
receive
treatment
at
the
polish
training
centre
in
spala
where
he
has
trained
with
triple
olympic
champion
robert
korzeniowski
over
the
past
five
fortnight
earlier
this
month
and
underwent
a
fair
extreme
treatment
called

and
it
promotes

heads
to
poland
again
on
sunday
where
he
will
be
having
daily
cryotherapy
in
addition
to
twicedaily
physio
sessions
and
on
the
way
to
what
jamie
hopes
will
be
a
return
to
racing
in
mobility
in
my
half
months
didnt
really
help
with
the
in
my
day
between
physio
and
pool
to
lift
very
light
weights
to
try
and
build
up
my
i
by
the
process
of
getting
go
and
do
a
big
bit
of
movement
my
whole
pelvic
area
all
down
my
lower
back
just
tightens
seeing
how
it
my
back
wont
tighten
up
as
preparations
for
the
new
season
by
taking
advice
from
british
sprint
icon
linford
at
sheffield
this
weekend
and
will
then
take
on
maurice
greene
and
kim
collins
in
birmingham
on
thisisanumber
from
linford
christie
is
broadening
my
mind
said
since
winning
relay
gold
at
the
athens
i
am
thisisanumber
hopefully
my
times
will
come
down
he
eating
the
right
foods
and
cutting
out
the
more
focused
about
what
i
am
weights
work
and
i
can
see
the
improvement
in
my
running
despite
playing
his
part
in
britains
successful
thisisanumber
relay
team
lewisfrancis
still
feels
the
frustration
of
missing
out
on
the
individual
thisisanumber
final
at
the
thisisanumber
made
it
to
the
semifinal
and
for
me
on
a
personal
level
that
was
an
and
build
up
for
the
next
i
do
between
now
and
then
will
be
geared
to
making
the
to
everton
as
manchester
united
cruised
into
the
fa
cup
goals
in
each
half
from
quinton
fortune
and
cristiano
ronaldo
silenced
the
jeers
at
goodison
before
ronaldo
scored
when
nigel
martyn
parried
paul
scholes
when
roy
carroll
who
was
later
struck
by
a
missile
saved
at
his
be
a
potential
flashpoint
and
he
was
involved
in
an
angry
exchange
with
a
spectator
even
before
with
a
deafening
chorus
of
jeers
from
the
crowd
that
once
idolised
the
to
be
alert
to
scramble
away
a
header
from
bent
near
the
united
to
take
complete
control
with
a
supreme
passing
display
on
a
goodison
park
pitch
that
was
cutting
thisisanumber
minutes
rising
to
meet
ronaldos
cross
from
eight
yards
after
the
portuguese
youngster
had
been
allowed
too
much
time
and
space
by
the
hapless
gary
clearcut
chances
and
they
almost
paid
the
price
for
not
making
the
most
of
their
domination
two
minutes
before
into
the
area
but
bent
played
onside
by
gabriel
heintze
hesitated
and
carroll
plunged
at
his
fee
to
thisisanumber
minutes
when
ronaldos
low
drive
from
thisisanumber
yards
took
a
deflection
off
tony
hibbert
but
martyn
dived
to
save
three
minutes
later
when
rooneys
big
moment
almost
arrived
as
he
raced
clean
through
but
once
again
the
veteran
keeper
was
in
outstanding
do
when
united
doubled
their
lead
after
thisisanumber
minutes
as
they
doubled
their
martyn
could
only
parry
the
ball
out
for
ronaldo
who
reacted
first
to
score
limped
off
with
an

we

i

very
satisfied
with

even
without

made
it

wins
in

league
games
with
a

at

of

the

top
scorer
this

with

the
injury
in
the
thisisanumber

against

for
not

he
was
carrying
an
injuries
to
both
alan

for

defender
william
dismissal
put
everton
on
the
back
foot
in
a
game
they
ultimately
lost
thisisanumber
saying
gallas
after
looking
over
the
video
evidence
should
set
the
record
straight
by
conceding
that
the
dismissal
was
right
and
correct
moyes
added
my
comments
on
saturday
came
immediately
after
the
final
whistle
and
at
a
point
when
i
had
only
had
the
opportunity
to
see
one
very
quick
rerun
of
the
incidentthe
club
website
also
reported
that
beattie
who
seemed
unrepentant
after
saturdays
match
insisting
gallas
would
have
stayed
down
a
lot
longer
if
he
had
headbutted
him
has
now
totally
out
of
character
james
has
never
even
been
suspended
before
in
his
career
his
actions
were
unacceptable
and
had
a
detrimental
effect
on
his
to
myself
his
teammates
and
to
the
everton
supporters
immediately
after
the
game
and
that
was
the
right
thing
to
have
the
normal
club
a
fair
player
and
i
know
how
upset
he
is
by
what
has
do
still
believe
the
chelsea
player
in
question
did
go
down
too
easily
speaking
immediately
after
the
game
moyes
said
i
dont
think
it
was
a
sendingoff
i
have
been
a
centrehalf
in
my
time
and
i
would
have
been
ashamed
to
have
gone
down
as
easily
as
john
terry
have
gone
down
in
the
same
butting
somebody
from
behind
while
you
are
running
after
centrehalves
i
thought
it
was
a
push
initially
and
i
still
dont
think
it
was
a
sendingoff
an
angry
beattie
initially
said
he
gallas
would
have
stayed
down
a
lot
longer
if
i
had
headbutted
an
intentional
the
corner
and
william
gallas
was
looking
over
his
shoulder
and
blocking
me
running
and
i
said
to
myself
if
youre
going
to
stay
in
my
way
ill
go
straight
over
wasnt
an
intentional
he
is
close
to
agreeing
to
a
new
contract
at
old
august
thisisanumber
on
a
fiveyeardeal
is
a
regular
in
the
united
an
offer
to
renew
the
contract
but
im
trying
not
to
think
about
it
he
told
the
news
of
the
club
and
it
will
be
resolved
agreement
for
both
sides
ronaldo
refused
to
commit
his
longterm
future
to
the
knows
he
clubs
than
this
a
big
his
backing
to
the
reinstatement
of
the
home
international
proposed
by
the
new
chief
executive
of
the
northern
irish
fa
howard
wells
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
four
home
as
to
whether
the
fixtures
could
be
accommodated
at
the
end
of
each
would
add
meaning
to
friendly
games
and
thats
something
thats
needed
the
home
international
series
was
done
away
with
in
thisisanumber
with
the
traditional
scotlandengland
fixture
continuing
until
be
delighted
to
see
a
highlight
of
the
end
of
the
season
he
friendly
with
russia
last
week
and
they
made
seven
substitutions
while
only
around
thisisanumber
fans
turned
up
to
draw
against
holland
the
way
scotland
were
slammed
in
the
past
for
poor
results
in
on
in
friendly
to
go
down
if
players
dont
apply
themselves
in
the
manner
they
of
the
home
internationals
the
only
problem
would
be
fitting
them
in
to
the
fixture
apology
to
the
egyptian
people
in
an
attempt
to
rejoin
the
national
in
cairo
on
sunday
that
he
is
sorry
for
the
problems
that
have
led
to
his
exclusion
from
the
pharaohs
since
july
last
have
to
say
today
all
there
is
to
say
is
that
i
came
specially
from
england
to
egypt
to
rejoin
the
national
team
and
to
apologise
for
all
my
mistakes
mido
was
axed
by
former
coach
marco
tardelli
after
failing
to
answer
a
national
callup
claiming
he
had
a
groin
friendly
for
his
club
as
roma
within
thisisanumber
hours
of
a
world
cup
qualifying
match
at
home
to
cameroon
last
to
give
orders
and
say
when
i
want
to
always
make
sure
that
i
put
the
nationals
teams
matches
as
my
top
are
playing
with
a
new
spirit
as
i
saw
them
play
against
belgium
egypt
won
thisisanumber
on
wednesday
and
i
simply
want
to
add
to
their
rude
to
the
egyptian
press
at
times
but
now
i
have
gained
more
experience
and
know
that
i
will
never
go
anywhere
without
the
presss
david
beckham
and
zinedine
zidane
had
the
press
opposing
fact
that
the
press
can
be
against
me
at
times
and
i
dont
have
to
overreact
when
this
welcomed
the
apology
and
said
no
one
had
exerted
pressure
on
mido
to
affect
mido
in
anyway
on
the
contrary
it
makes
him
a
bigger
star
and
a
role
model
for
all
football
players
shalaby
apology
mido
would
be
available
for
the
national
side
if
coach
hassan
shehata
chose
loan
deal
near
the
end
of
the
january
transfer
window
scoring
twice
on
his
debut
against
to
nine
points
after
a
scrappy
victory
over
manchester
to
the
near
post
with
a
low
shot
which
went
in
via
a
deflection
off
richard
dunne
to
put
united
hooked
a
volley
over
david
james
head
and
into
his

he
shot
wide
from
three
yards
in

looked
unlikely
to
earn
the
win
they
needed
to
maintain
any
chance
of
catching
chelsea
in
the
title
than
patient
and
they
managed
to
fashion
just
one
chance
a
paul
scholes
header
over
the
to
sit
back
and
try
and
hit
their
rivals
on
the
break
as
the
game
settled
into
a
tepid
interrupting
the
monotony
looking
lively
down
the
right
and
causing
gabriel
heinze
be
a
difficult
opponent
when
the
tricky
winger
embarrassed
him
near
the
him
past
brown
and
he
delivered
a
pinpoint
centre
to
the
feet
of
why
he
has
never
scored
against
united
by
sidefooting
the
easy
chance
an
earlier
clash
with
sylvain
distin
and
cristiano
ronaldo
came
on
to
replace
discomfort
and
looked
set
to
inject
some
muchneeded
pace
into
the
united
dunne
but
that
was
all
about
to
and
there
was
a
renewed
urgency
about
their
in
a
carbon
copy
of
citys
best
firsthalf
chance
rooney
showed
mcmanaman
how
to
do
it
even
if
he
needed
the
help
of
dunnes
who
had
been
having
a
fine
horrible
own
goal
when
attempting
to
volley
clear
rooneys
cross
and
united
seemed
home
and
fowler
missed
another
great
chance
from
close
well
from
kiki
a
third
late
on
when
substitute
ryan
giggs
hit
the
had
a
great
chance
to
take
the
lead
and
the
first
goal
was
always
going
to
be
tempo
but
then
we
allowed
them
to
dictate
the
pace
a
bit
too
chances
two
after
wed
gone
thisisanumber
down
the
one
mcmanaman
missed
was
very
similar

rooney
scored
from

boss

it

i

were

we

of

competition
with
a
brilliant

in

insisted
he

this

we
are
still

which
are
very
chelsea
in

and
get
to
the

of

financially
it

it

that

maybe
not
for

he
do
everything
to

about

and
the
bbc
sport
website
from
thisisanumber
sport
also
admits
gerrard
who
has
been
constantly
linked
with
chelsea
will
have
the
final
say
on
his
is
above
thisisanumber
or
thisisanumber
we
will
not
accept
to
know
we
cant
keep
steven
against
his
will
on
the
subject
of
liverpools
finances
parry
also
revealed
the
club
is
ready
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
sponsorship
deal
for
its
proposed
new
sport
pundit
and
former
liverpool
stalwart
alan
hansen
he
insisted
talks
on
new
investment
are
ongoing
but
added
the
door
has
not
closed
on
shareholder
and
lifelong
fan
steve
in
july
thisisanumber
from
a
similar
role
at
the
premier
lows
during
his
time
in
charge
at
anfield
and
he
had
a
busy
summer
overseeing
the
arrival
of
new
manager
rafael
benitez
and
managing
to
hold
on
to
steven
and
prize
asset
parry
revealed
real
madriddidask
for
an
option
on
the
england
midfield
man
during
negotiations
for
striker
fernando
ways
of
saying
they
got
more
out
of
the
deal
for
fernando
morientes
but
the
response
to
real
madrid
was
the
same
steven
is
not
for
sale
but
when
asked
if
gerrard
would
be
a
liverpool
player
on
the
first
day
of
next
season
parry
said
i
sincerely
hope
he
will
that
we
are
trying
to
build
a
team
around
he
can
argue
with
to
win
things
with
liverpool
more
than
hed
like
to
do
anything
by
next
players
who
feel
the
same
so
we
all
have
a
common
aim
it
is
expected
chelsea
will
test
liverpool
with
a
thisisanumber
bid
in
the
summer
but
parry
claims
he
will
be
in
no
mood
to
open
secrets
about
steven
most
of
which
have
been
complete
deal
tied
up
last
summer
parry
far
as
we
were
concerned
he
was
not
for
sale
and
we
didnt
want
to
sell
in
the
to
stay
but
we
are
also
realistic
enough
and
have
enough
respect
for
steven
and
he
has
enough
respect
for
us
to
know
that
it
is
his
decision
that
will
be
a
player
like
steven
against
his
idea
we
are
going
to
accept
offers
for
steven
and
then
tell
him
by
the
way
weve
decided
to
sell
you
is
not
on
the
currently
in
the
process
of
finalising
funding
for
liverpools
new
stadium
in
stanley
park
which
is
set
to
open
in
with
emirates
to
sponsor
their
new
ground
complete
with
naming
rights
has
given
the
anfield
club
serious
food
for
historically
it
is
something
i
have
been
against
and
i
have
been
on
record
as
saying
that
but
i
think
the
size
of
the
arsenal
deal
is
a
real
deals
have
been
done
frankly
far
too
cheaply
and
it
just
hasnt
even
been
worth
sort
of
deal
that
causes
you
to
draw
breath
and
say
wow
thats
interesting
my
personal
point
of
view
is
that
i
would
find
it
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
palatable
than
a
shared
stadium
some
liverpool
fans
would
find
such
a
move
highly
controversial
but
parry
countered
i
recognise
it
would
be
an
emotive
issue
for
many
supporters
but
you
look
at
the
amount
of
money
available
and
it
could
go
into
the
how
strong
an
issue
is
it
time
will
be
anfield
not
least
because
of
where
it
is
but
do
we
need
to
investigate
the
possibilities
of
sponsorship
i
think
it
would
be
remiss
not
made
a
decision
that
we
will
go
down
that
road
but
i
think
it
is
clearly
something
we
have
to
exploreon
the
subject
of
possible
new
investment
parry
revealed
liverpool
are
still
in
negotiations
with
a
mystery
investor
with
rumours
of
interest
from
the
middle
steve
morgan
who
got
frustrated
by
failed
bids
and
what
he
claimed
was
indecision
by
the
him
as
a
stalking
horse
to
attract
other
bids
but
parry
explained
steve
has
never
been
used
as
a
stalking
not
the
way
we
do
the
course
of
concluding
a
deal
in
the
summer
but
it
didnt
appear
relatively
late
in
the
day
just
prior
to
the
agm
in
december
and
as
i
have
said
it
was
of
such
potential
magnitude
and
that
potential
is
so
exciting
we
felt
we
had
to
evaluate
on
its
own
there
for
all
to
see
and
who
knows
what
the
next
few
months
will
hold
the
door
isnt
closed
on
with
steve
last
making
liverpool
so
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
door
is
not
closedi
would
take
thisisanumber
if
we
had
no
investment
but
if
we
did
keep
gets
us
cash
what
difference
does
it
make
thisisanumber
for
gerrard
i
dont
care
who
you
are
the
directors
would
take
the
money
and
it
is
the
way
it
should
money
go
despite
gerrards
club
has
effectively
forced
gerrard
to
publicly
make
the
decision
for
himself
which
i
think
is
the
right
thing
to
to
his
future
to
the
club
for
the
long
out
of
the
club
like
michael
owen
did
for
very
little
completely
rebuild
the
squad
however
if
we
can
afford
to
do
this
and
keep
gerrard
we
will
be
better
for
gerrards
transfer
for
any
fee
over
any
future
gerrard
transfer
cannot
be
construed
as
a
lack
of
ambition
by
the
club
to
not
try
and
keep
their
best
move
by
his
obvious
love
of
the
club
and
determination
to
out
and
says
that
he
is
would
be
foolish
not
to
you
buy
or
who
would
come
pending
possible
nonchampions

revealed
that
wes
brown
will
start
alongside
jamie
carragher
in
the

eriksson
replied
i
could
tell
you
five
central
defenders
are
away
because
of
for
carragher
and
brown
to
show
what
they
can
do
at
this
that
he
had
been
impressed
by
wrightphillips
form
for
manchester
season
and
i
look
forward
to
seeing
him
and
he
added
that
andy
johnson
and
stewart
downing
the
other
two
new
players
in
the
squad
would
also
get
a
chance
to
or
get
the
chance
to
play
some
a
year
ago
but
he
is
doing
a
great
season
and
scoring
a
lot
of
great
are
not
too
many
leftfooted
players
in
the
two
metatarsal
bones
in
his
foot
and
will
be
out
for
at
least
six
the
injury
sustained
during
the
premiership
win
at
blackburn
on
to
heal
this
injury
and
then
i
need
a
few
more
weeks
to
be
completely
fit
again
he
told
dutch
newspaper
algemeen
serious
but
because
of
the
swelling
it
was
impossible
to
make
a
final
diagnosis
the
thisisanumber
missed
the
first
three
months
of
the
season
with
a
similar
injury
after
a
challenge
with
romas
olivier
then
last
summer
when
i
had
the
same
injury
on
my
other
three
days
but
i
stayed
sidelined
for
a
long
take
me
six
to
eight
weeks
chelsea
physio
mike
banks
was
hopeful
that
robben
could
return
at
some
point
in
could
be
playing
next
month
banks
told
the
clubs
side
of
his
foot
the
other
is
a
small
break
on
the
third
metatarsal
that
has
become
so
famous
since
the
last
world
cup
and
which
has
kept
scott
parker
out
for
two
monthsdavid
beckham
suffered
a
broken
metatarsal
in
the
build
up
to
the
thisisanumber
world
cup
in
korea
and
part
of
the
blues
push
for
four
trophies
claims
he
knew
instantly
something
was
wrong
when
he
was
felled
by
blackburn
midfielder
aaron
mokoena
hit
me
with
a
wild
kick
on
my
left
he
wins
his
thisisanumber
cap
in
wednesdays
friendly
against
hungary
in
as
coach
after
succeeding
mark
hughes
admits
he
is
surprised
that
giggs
has
only
just
reached
the
united
proportionately
it
doesnt
seem
that
many
for
wales
toshack
of
all
welsh
internationals
and
on
his
thisisanumber
cap
its
appropriate
hes
captain
giggs
admits
he
had
briefly
considered
retirement
from
the
international
game
but
is
now
targetting
playing
for
wales
in
the
thisisanumber
european
club
manager
sir
alex
ferguson
talked
him
into
extending
his
wales
with
sir
alex
but
he
urged
me
to
carry
on
giggs
have
no
weight
problems
and
keep
myself
fit
so
in
three
or
four
years
time
i
will
be
able
to
play
in
the
european
finals
if
we
get
to
play
for
my
club
and
country
and
he
was
keen
for
me
to
continue
because
i
am
fit
enoughgiggs
admits
he
was
wavering
and
considering
joining
the
likes
of
former
wales
skipper
gary
speed
and
united
teammate
paul
scholes
in
committing
the
remaining
years
of
his
career
to
club
making
the
toshack
era
even
more
successful
than
the
time
hughes
spent
at
the
first
cap
as
a
thisisanumber
in
thisisanumber
an
away
loss
to
germany
and
now
faces
his
landmark
appearance
at
the
age
of
hungary
there
is
every
chance
that
he
will
become
the
permanent
successor
to
he
sees
giggs
as
a
longterm
it
is
appropriate
that
ryan
giggs
will
be
captain
its
his
thisisanumber
cap
and
hes
known
for
some
time
about
that
toshack
of
his
first
match
since
replacing
hughes
and
giggs
said
its
my
thisisanumber
cap
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
it
and
i
hope
to
play
a
lot
more
times
from
here
on
the
players
feel
the
the
top
players
certainly
see
it
as
it
is
something
i
have
taken
on
for
wales
as
well
as
united
these
past
few
things
he
is
aiming
to
build
his
side
around
the
experienced
lads
right
up
to
the
next
tournament
the
euro
thisisanumber
be
around
for
the
next
european
tournament
by
then
i
will
be
thisisanumber
so
hopefully
i
will
still
be
hoping
to
be
around
giggs
own
personal
future
at
old
trafford
is
still
up
in
the
air
as
he
has
yet
to
reach
agreement
on
a
new
contract
with
manchester
united
offering
one
extra
year
and
giggs
seeking
to
the
back
of
my
mind
at
the
moment
said
the
club
and
i
am
just
concentrated
on
is
a
twoyear
deal
about
to
be
offered
because
that
is
what
i
am
looking
for
to
get
it
sorted
united
have
been
playing
and
my
own
form
you
have
to
enjoy
manchester
city
this
week
then
the
everton
cup
tie
followed
by
ac
milan
in
the
champions
league
and
my
first
wales
game
under
john
toshack
so
its
an
important
out
within
a
month
whether
he
is
to
be
offered
a
new
oneyear
of
contract
in
the
summer
and
although
his
age
may
count
against
him
he
feels
he
can
play
on
for
another
like
to
stay
for
one
more
the
next
month
so
i
am
waiting
to
see
he
but
i
think
i
have
proved
i
am
fit
thisisanumber
and
at
first
he
struggled
to
adapt
to
life
in
manager
kevin
game
was
faster
than
anything
he
was
used
to
but
he
drove
himself
back
into
the
midfielder
dragan
mladenovic
to
real
sociedad
despite
the
closure
of
the
january
transfer
by
the
spanish
fa

to

he
has
made
just
six

in
six
months
with
the

for

after
our
exclusive
interview
with

reach
the
most
crucial
point
in

spiralling
above

package
of
a
size
and
stature
that
will
restore
liverpool
to
their
place
at
european
footballs
top
appears
to
sit
easily
with
parry
who
has
forged
a
reputation
as
one
of
footballs
most
respected
administrators
since
his
days
at
the
fledgling
premier
since
thisisanumber
a
fact
that
causes
deep
discomfort
inside
anfield
as
they
attempt
to
muscle
in
on
the
top
three
of
chelsea
manchester
united
and
warding
off
every
top
club
in
world
football
as
they
eye
captain
steven
gerrard
and
you
can
see
parry
is
a
man
with
a
lot
on
his
conference
room
deep
inside
liverpools
heartbeat
the
kop
end
parry
spoke
to
us
with
brutal
honesty
about
the
crucial
months
asked
to
reveal
the
name
of
the
mystery
investor
currently
courting
liverpool
a
polite
smile
deflected
the
everything
else
head
on
in
measured
tones
that
underscore
the
belief
that
liverpool
still
mean
challengers
again
and
locking
the
pieces
together
that
will
help
return
the
trophy
to
liverpool
is
parrys
of
those
planks
in
place
in
the
form
of
new
manager
rafael
personality
and
methods
is
an
indication
of
his
clear
feeling
that
he
has
struck
renewed
optimism
about
the
years
at
a
club
with
a
unique
history
and
to
parry
a
lifelong
liverpool
supporter
but
his
quiet
determination
suggests
he
is
no
mood
to
be
found
plans
and
parrys
insistence
that
all
offers
will
be
refused
is
a
firm
statement
of
the
final
say
and
parry
acknowledges
that
but
he
is
determined
to
provide
the
framework
and
environment
for
liverpool
and
gerrard
to
new
investment
hawkpoint
were
appointed
as
advisors
to
flush
out
interest
in
march
and
went
while
the
most
serious
statement
of
intent
came
from
tycoon
and
lifelong
fan
steve
rejected
having
come
close
in
the
summer
only
for
talks
to
break
down
over
potential
costs
for
the
new
ready
and
willing
to
invest
in
liverpool
and
parry
has
kept
the
door
ajar
despite
currently
seeking
investment
contact
with
liverpool
or
their
advisors
since
last
december
blaming
indecision
at
board
level
as
he
publicly
withdrew
his
thisisanumber
was
being
used
to
lure
in
others
so
any
new
approach
would
now
have
to
come
from
another
benefactor
with
trails
leading
to
the
middle
east
and
america
but
all
met
with
an
understandable
veil
of
secrecy
from
as
crucial
to
liverpools
future
but
is
refusing
to
become
emotionally
attached
to
the
only
be
built
on
an
affordable
basis
and
will
not
make
future
liverpool
management
hostages
to
the
new
the
figures
do
not
stack
up
but
there
has
been
a
vital
new
development
in
north
london
that
has
reshaped
liverpools
the
idea
of
stadium
sponsorship
and
potential
naming
rights
but
the
realism
of
arsenals
stunning
thisisanumber
deal
for
their
new
emirates
stadium
at
ashburton
has
changed
the
and
admits
liverpool
would
be
missing
a
trick
not
to
explore
the
will
reel
at
any
attempt
to
call
the
new
stadium
anything
other
than
just
anfield
but
the
maths
of
modernday
football
decree
that
multimillions
for
stadium
and
team
could
ease
the
had
no
investment
but
if
we
did
keep
gets
us
cash
what
difference
does
it
make
thisisanumber
for
gerrard
i
dont
care
who
you
are
the
directors
would
take
the
money
and
it
is
the
way
it
should
money
go
despite
gerrards
club
has
effectively
forced
gerrard
to
publicly
make
the
decision
for
himself
which
i
think
is
the
right
thing
to
to
his
future
to
the
club
for
the
long
out
of
the
club
like
michael
owen
did
for
very
little
completely
rebuild
the
squad
however
if
we
can
afford
to
do
this
and
keep
gerrard
we
will
be
better
for
gerrards
transfer
for
any
fee
over
any
future
gerrard
transfer
cannot
be
construed
as
a
lack
of
ambition
by
the
club
to
not
try
and
keep
their
best
move
by
his
obvious
love
of
the
club
and
determination
to
out
and
says
that
he
is
would
be
foolish
not
to
you
buy
or
who
would
come
pending
possible
nonchampions
league
provides
an
important
opportunity
to
work
with
your
game
itself
can
often
be
a
would
be
better
to
get
the
players
together
for
the
week
and
do
away
with
the
thisisanumber
minutes
at
the
you
should
have
these
games
or
not
and
if
you
look
at
it
that
way
you
would
probably
say
youre
better
not
doing
happy
as
it
would
reduce
the
risk
of
players
returning
to
domestic
duty
that
scrapping
friendlies
is
counterproductive
because
the
only
way
for
a
team
to
get
better
is
by
easier
it
is
when
it
comes
to
the
crunch
in
games
like
world
cup
quarterfinals
against
will
play
his
strongest
side
for
the
first
thisisanumber
minutes
and
then
send
out
an
entirely
different
one
in
the
second
player
to
come
on
as
substitute
in
a
side
with
a
few
changes
let
alone
a
whole
teams
im
not
sure
there
is
a
satisfactory
right
this
week
is
walter
to
have
a
training
camp
instead
of
a
friendly
for
his
first
international
week
since
replacing
berti
you
would
expect
from
walter
who
is
a
canny
hard
time
recently
that
he
is
better
off
getting
them
together
in
a
relaxed
atmosphere
and
trying
to
generate
some
team
spirit
before
the
next
world
cup
on
wednesday
and
they
had
been
badly
beaten
it
would
have
done
them
no
good
in
charge
of
wales
and
it
will
be
important
for
him
to
get
a
decent
result
against
on
individuals
and
how
to
play
and
will
probably
look
more
at
the
performance
but
the
public
wants
balance
for
but
if
you
lose
it
becomes
a
stat
that
can
be
used
against
good
to
try
out
players
like
middlesbrough
winger
stewart
downing
or
crystal
palace
striker
andy
svengoran
erikssons
side
were
given
a
lesson
by
spain
in
the
last
game
they
at
least
give
the
likes
of
wes
brown
and
jamie
carragher
a
chance
to
simply
be
a
case
of
waiting
at
home
with
fingers
took
a
blow
on
sunday
as
they
fell
to
a
thisisanumber
defeat
at
home
to
atletico
start
with
a
goal
in
the
first
equalise
for
barca
when
he
put
a
penalty
wide
but
torres
made
no
such
mistake
with
a
lastminute
thisisanumber
win
over
espanyol
on
saturday
reduces
barcas
lead
to
four
his
first
goal
for
real
in
the
comfortable
victory
at
the
before
raul
bagged
a
scoring
in
the
thisisanumber
minute
with
a
low
came
off
in
the
thisisanumber
minute
with
a
shoulder
injury
but
should
be
fit
for
englands
game
against
for
raul
after
thisisanumber
minutes
with
the
game
already
primera
liga
games
since
coach
wanderley
luxemburgo
took
sport
on
five
and
the
bbc
sport
website
from
thisisanumber
sport
also
admits
gerrard
who
has
been
constantly
linked
with
chelsea
will
have
the
final
say
on
his
is
above
thisisanumber
or
thisisanumber
we
will
not
accept
to
know
we
cant
keep
steven
against
his
will
on
the
subject
of
liverpools
finances
parry
also
revealed
the
club
is
ready
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
sponsorship
deal
for
its
proposed
new
sport
pundit
and
former
liverpool
stalwart
alan
hansen
he
insisted
talks
on
new
investment
are
ongoing
but
added
the
door
has
not
closed
on
shareholder
and
lifelong
fan
steve
in
july
thisisanumber
from
a
similar
role
at
the
premier
lows
during
his
time
in
charge
at
anfield
and
he
had
a
busy
summer
overseeing
the
arrival
of
new
manager
rafael
benitez
and
managing
to
hold
on
to
steven
and
prize
asset
parry
revealed
real
madriddidask
for
an
option
on
the
england
midfield
man
during
negotiations
for
striker
fernando
ways
of
saying
they
got
more
out
of
the
deal
for
fernando
morientes
but
the
response
to
real
madrid
was
the
same
steven
is
not
for
sale
but
when
asked
if
gerrard
would
be
a
liverpool
player
on
the
first
day
of
next
season
parry
said
i
sincerely
hope
he
will
that
we
are
trying
to
build
a
team
around
he
can
argue
with
to
win
things
with
liverpool
more
than
hed
like
to
do
anything
by
next
players
who
feel
the
same
so
we
all
have
a
common
aim
it
is
expected
chelsea
will
test
liverpool
with
a
thisisanumber
bid
in
the
summer
but
parry
claims
he
will
be
in
no
mood
to
open
secrets
about
steven
most
of
which
have
been
complete
deal
tied
up
last
summer
parry
far
as
we
were
concerned
he
was
not
for
sale
and
we
didnt
want
to
sell
in
the
to
stay
but
we
are
also
realistic
enough
and
have
enough
respect
for
steven
and
he
has
enough
respect
for
us
to
know
that
it
is
his
decision
that
will
be
a
player
like
steven
against
his
idea
we
are
going
to
accept
offers
for
steven
and
then
tell
him
by
the
way
weve
decided
to
sell
you
is
not
on
the
currently
in
the
process
of
finalising
funding
for
liverpools
new
stadium
in
stanley
park
which
is
set
to
open
in
with
emirates
to
sponsor
their
new
ground
complete
with
naming
rights
has
given
the
anfield
club
serious
food
for
historically
it
is
something
i
have
been
against
and
i
have
been
on
record
as
saying
that
but
i
think
the
size
of
the
arsenal
deal
is
a
real
deals
have
been
done
frankly
far
too
cheaply
and
it
just
hasnt
even
been
worth
sort
of
deal
that
causes
you
to
draw
breath
and
say
wow
thats
interesting
my
personal
point
of
view
is
that
i
would
find
it
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
palatable
than
a
shared
stadium
some
liverpool
fans
would
find
such
a
move
highly
controversial
but
parry
countered
i
recognise
it
would
be
an
emotive
issue
for
many
supporters
but
you
look
at
the
amount
of
money
available
and
it
could
go
into
the
how
strong
an
issue
is
it
time
will
be
anfield
not
least
because
of
where
it
is
but
do
we
need
to
investigate
the
possibilities
of
sponsorship
i
think
it
would
be
remiss
not
made
a
decision
that
we
will
go
down
that
road
but
i
think
it
is
clearly
something
we
have
to
exploreon
the
subject
of
possible
new
investment
parry
revealed
liverpool
are
still
in
negotiations
with
a
mystery
investor
with
rumours
of
interest
from
the
middle
steve
morgan
who
got
frustrated
by
failed
bids
and
what
he
claimed
was
indecision
by
the
him
as
a
stalking
horse
to
attract
other
bids
but
parry
explained
steve
has
never
been
used
as
a
stalking
not
the
way
we
do
the
course
of
concluding
a
deal
in
the
summer
but
it
didnt
appear
relatively
late
in
the
day
just
prior
to
the
agm
in
december
and
as
i
have
said
it
was
of
such
potential
magnitude
and
that
potential
is
so
exciting
we
felt
we
had
to
evaluate
on
its
own
there
for
all
to
see
and
who
knows
what
the
next
few
months
will
hold
the
door
isnt
closed
on
with
steve
last
making
liverpool
so
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
door
is
not
closedi
would
take
thisisanumber
if
we
had
no
investment
but
if
we
did
keep

does
it

although
he
admitted
they
still
have
plenty

next

but
you
cant
deny
its
exciting
he
revenue
it
could
bring
in
would
certainly
help
our
draw
but
weve
still
got
to
beat
a
premiership
and
thats
going
to
be
a
hard
game
but
if
we
do
there
will
be
some
celebrationwelcomed
the
opportunity
to
face
he
a
difficult
replay
judging
by
the
way
brentford
came
back
at
us
on
saturday
and
the
fact
that
united
have
come
out
of
the
hat
will
give
them
even
more
so
many
times
in

and
beaten
them
at

why
not
win
the

even
though
its
a

one
said
the

all
now
tied

five
points
from
three
matches
although
the

look
to
have
a
slight
edge
after

draws
in

and
great
football
but
when
you
to
go
to
these
places
the
other
teams
are
going
to
have
the
majority
of
the
the
team
and
a
point
was
the
least
we
deserved
because
we
had
a
number
of
to
get
the
three
points

we
are
happy
with
a
point
and
that
will
give
us
confidence
going

out
of

of
good

the

looked
assured
in

more
advanced
position
against

being
a
natural
rightback
it
was
something
he
kerr
looked
at
because
france
play
strongly
down
the
lefthand
and
stephen
carr
and
i
enjoyed
the
game
particularly
as
the
defence
and

held
together
well

that
it
was
not
typical
of
his
fellow
portuguese
to
lodge
a
not
give
a
news
conference
he
which
has
conceded
fewest
goals
in
the
english
league
and
they
defend
very
well
so
i
am
very
pleased
with
the
am
pleased
to
have
won
this
captain
steven
gerrard
not
to
play
down
their
champions
league
ambitions
and
be
more
unlikely
to
win
the
trophy
this
and
said
to
him
that
in
future
its
better
to
think
we
can
win
the
champions
winners
here
and
everyone
thinking
only
of
when
we
lose
i
only
think
of
the
next
game
you
dont
know
what
the
draw
will
game
maybe
we
will
draw
a
side
that
isnt
so
strong
or
a
side
with
injuries
or
suspensions

grabbed
thisisanumber

been
unable

the
way

ive
settled

linked
owen
with
a
move
back
to

their
interest

the
england

at

ive
not

place

the
stressed
that
the
development
of
their
new
thisisanumber
stadium
had
no
affect
on
wengers
spending
told
bbc
and
in
the
coming
and
he
knows
our
finances
are
very
strongedelman
added
that
it
was
pointless
having
a
brand
new
stadium
if
the
team
did
not
match
the
surroundings
but
if
the
team
arent
performing
on
the
pitch
then
there
isnt
great
respect
in
having
a
fabulous
stadium

for
our

earned
them
a
thisisanumber
win
and
a
place
in
the
uefa

last
leg
it
gave
us
a
great
advantage
he
said
after
the
thisisanumber
aggregate
in
the
minds
of
some
players
the
job
was
done
but
then
they
got
a
goal
and
perhaps
made
us
a
bit
nervous
shearers
goal
moved
him
within
thisisanumber
of
jackie
milburns
club
scoring
record
of
thisisanumber
for
the
think
beating
the
record
would
have
any
bearing
on
his
decision
to
retire
at
the
end
of
the
this
year
he
would
want
to
stay
next
year
anyway
he
he
always
has
done
and
i
think
it
was
the
power
and
pace
that
beat
the
goalkeeper
souness
also
paid
tribute
to
laurent
robert
who
was
at
the
heart
of
much
of

well

was

at

had
a
gameplan
they
knocked
the
ball
forward
especially
in
the
first
half
and
we
struggled
to
deal
with
better
but
it
was
frustrating
because
we
got
the

now
go

look

to

goalscorer
jimmy

hasselbaink
added
it
wasnt
a
particularly
beautiful
match
to
watch
but
they
made
it
difficult
for
of
luck
and
i
think
we
got
that
when
my
shot
went
through
the
legs
of
their
in

would
have
been
a
little
bit
special

into
the

hero
saving
superbly
from

and

with
eight
minutes
at

his

dropping
into

threaten
taking

delivering
a

that
was
held
by

at

after

dispossesed
sotiris
kyrgiakos
and
sent
his
strike
partner
clear
with
only
the
goalkeeper
to
away
bellamys
disappointing
low
drive
from
thisisanumber
when
the
ball
fell
to
hartson
just
inside
the
box
and
the
dutch
goalkeeper
made
a
brave
for
barry
ferguson
as
mcleish
stuck
by
the
side
that
thumped
four
goals
past
break
down
and
douglas
was
not
threatened
until
thisisanumber
minutes
after
the
only
for
the
celtic
goalkeeper
to
beat
away
his
powerful
thisisanumber
prevented
hartson
pouncing
from
five
yards
of
the

box
but
the

shot
on
the
turn
was
again
beaten
away
by

somehow
letting

for

looking
ahead
to
the
quarterfinal
jol
said
newcastle
have
got
a
very
good
side
and
they
are
always
difficult
however
he
added
that
his
side
who
are
four
places
above
the
magpies
in
the
premiership
were
not
afraid
of
and
scorer
of
the
crucial
second
goal
echoed
his
managers
sentiments
on
the
lasteight
confident
and
in
the
last
few
games
weve
played
well
and
hopefully
we
can
go
there
and
get
the
win
he
which
included
goals
from
noe
pamarot
and
mido
was
not
pretty
to
its
all
about
the
result
the
irishman
be
difficult
with
the
we
still
tried
to
pass
said
to
us
at
halftime
to
keep
being
patient
and
that
the
goal
will
come
forest
manager
gary
megson
conceded
his
team
did
not
deserve
anything
after
a
poor
and
concede
two
goals
from
corners
youre
going
to
have
an
uphill
battle
against
a
very
good
team
he
like
we
did
well
not
get
another
at
times
we
thought
the
system
would
be
enough
but
we
didnt
look
like
to
the
to
the
real
madrid
starting
lineup
and
inspired
a
thisisanumber
win
over
real
betis
on
wednesday
by
scoring
the
first
could
play
a
game
from
the
start
game
and
it
is
obvious
that
i
am
happy
to
have
scored
another
my
performances
and
i
think
i
have
had
some
months
that
were
not
so
good
and
others
that
were
very
good
owen
starting
his
third
successive
la

match
converted

for

barcelona
and
owen
is
confident
real
can
close
the
against
betis
and
i
think
we
can
get
back
in
touch
with
barcelona
and
us
and
that
is
the
bernabeu
on
thisisanumber
april
then
it
will
be

know
tomorrow

ferguson
said
milans

represent

for

they

he
nistelrooy
is
fit
again
but
the
scot
admitted
he
was
unsure
whether
to
start
the
dutchman
who
has
not
played
for
three
whether
he
will
struggle
with
the
early
pace
after
being
out
for
so
long
he
a
big
shout
but
it
is
a
major
decision
ferguson
though
is
confident
his
young
players
particularly
wayne
rooney
and
cristiano
ronaldo
are
up
to
the
this
cup
this
year
no
question
about
that
he
week
in
ronaldo

the

of

and
the
form
of
roy
keane
paul

we
must
have
a
fantastic
chance
it
is
a
view
shared
by
rooney
who
believes
if
we
can
get
past
milan
we
have
a
great
were
playing
milan
i
got
anyones
trophy
but
we
have
every
final
in

and
bring

back
to

milan
coach
carlo
ancelotti
said
his
team
were
looking
forward
to
returning
to
the
venue
where
they
lifted
europes
most
prestigious
club
title
two
seasons
shootout
after
a
thisisanumber
tie
at
old
trafford
and
ancelotti
said
we
are
all
very
happy
to
return
to
old
trafford
to
play
in
the
champions
league
and
this
will
give
us
great
motivation
ancelotti
said
he
was
aware
of
the
threat
united
posed
to
his
hopes
of
champions
league
them
to
take
control
of
the
to
their
play
but
to
play
our
game
he
they
use
the
wings
a
lot
and
we
will
have
to
make
sure
we
stop
is
uncertain
after
he
and
assistant
mark
aizlewood
refused
a
severance
their
last
thisisanumber
league
games
but
chairman
steve
vaughan
claims
he
cannot
afford
to
sack
the
thisisanumber
liverpool
settlement
so
they
could
resign
with
dignity
but
an
obvious
action
is
to
dismiss
so
technically
theyre
still
employees
vaughan
claimed
that
aizlewood
had
verbally
agreed
to
the
they
discussed
the
offer
with
their
solicitor
who
also
acts
as
their
agent
they
decided
to
withdraw
the
verbal
agreement
which
was
disappointing
rush
was
appointed
at
the
end
of
august
following
the
departure
of
former
liverpool
teammate
mark
wright
who
guided
chester
to
the
conference
title
last
when
rush
took
over
but
the
former
liverpool
striker
enjoyed
an
impressive
start
to
managerial
life
taking
the
club
into
the
third
round
of
the
fa
cup
and
winning
the
managerofthemonth
award
for
a
thisisanumber
defeat
at
shrewsbury
that
leaves
them
hovering
just
above
the
league
two
relegation
speculation
linking
him
with
a
move
from
arsenal
to
real

after
falling
victim
to
a
radio
to
real
madrid
sporting
director
emilio
butragueno
when
he
allegedly
berated
his
teammates
as
bad
real

the
thisisanumber
told
cadena
things
are
the
striker
joined
the
gunners
from
seville
for
thisisanumber
at
the
start
of
thisisanumber
but
it
has
frequently
been
reported
that
he
is
form
but
has
struggled
to
maintain
his
high
standards
as
arsenal
have
gradually
lost
the
premiership
initiative
to
manchester
united
and
im
going
to
have
to
carry
on
playing
with
some
bad
people
he
the
real
dressing
me
because
it
has
always
been
my
dream
since
i
was
little
to
play
there
before
the

moved

him
with

he
had
said
on
thursday
contract
at
arsenal
i
am
happy
here
and
committed
to
helping
the
team
win
more
trophies

meanwhile
was
angry
at
being
impersonated
by
the
radio

no
foundation
to
this
he
we
have
to
be
of
the
rumours
that
appear
in

after
his

thisisanumber
win
over

conceding
a

in

said

would

happily
accepted
that

and
had

nobody
would

talking
about
about

it
would
not
have
been
worth
remembering
that
last
made
two
very
fine
saves
and
i
am
happy
with
out
but
i
think
we
can
score
in
germany
certainly
one
and
that
will
make
all
the
difference
and
the
liverpool
boss
is
looking

to
having

was
suspended
for

leg
back
for
the
return
in
for

said
he
makes
everyone
else
play
better
and
the
opposition
pay
special
attention
to
him
which
gives
space
for
players
in

i
need

is
due

although
he
hopes
to
persuade

to
carry
players
who
would
excite
the
fans
and
were
monitoring
him
he
told
bbc
only
thisisanumber
but
i
dont
think
were
the
only
ones
monitoring
the
situation
at

has
also
hinted
he

shearer
may
carry
on
despite
his
stated
intent
to
retire
at
the
end
of
the
jackie
milburns

may
influence
the

between

currently
has

confident
he
will

he

were
not

also
looking

bring
in
a

of
new

once
the
current
campaign
has
been
new

in
the

we
have
got
lots
of
targets
he
the
last
day
of
the
season
to
say
who
are
we
going
to
target
display
in
the
thisisanumber
defeat
against
bayern
munich
was
our
worst
peformance
in
the
champions
gunners
hope
for
the
second
leg
but
wenger
said
the
only
positive
is
that
we
are
still
in
the
the
a
bad
struggle
but
thisisanumber
at
least
gives
us
a
chancegoalscorer
toure
was
also
at
fault
for
two
goals
and
wenger
said
we
need
to
help
toure
rebuild
his
confidence
as
he
is
low
at
the
moment
wenger
also
tried
to
stay
upbeat
himself
adding
but
there
is
enough
time
for
be
easier
but
life
goes
and
bad
i
still
have
confidence
in
the
quality
of
my
players
as
well
as
their
spirit
and
desire
but
wengers
bayern
counterpart
felix
magath
was
in
no
mood
to
celebrate
happy
despite
the
score
a
fourth
to
kill
the
tie
and
then
conceded
the
late
several
goals
against
us
on
their
own
turf
arsenal
keeper
jens
lehmann
whose
personal
rivalry
with
bayern
goalkeeper
oliver
kahn
was
not
helped
by
the
result
said
do
i
blame
myself
for
the
third
goal
as
a
goalkeeper
i
always
blame
very
easy
against
never
conceded
three
easy
goals
like
that
but
sometimes
it
go
through
at
thisisanumber
but
with
the
goal
we
have
manchester
united
know
they
made
a
mistake
by
selling
him
in
in
the
champions
league
game
on
wednesday
and
the
thisisanumber
dutchmans
presence
is
sure
to
add
spice
to
the
me
stam
told
uefas
champions
but
they
wanted
to
sell
you
there
is
nothing
you
can
sir
alex
ferguson
surprised
the
football
world
and
stam
by
selling
the
dutchman
to
lazio
for
thisisanumber
in
august
claimed
in
his
autobiography
that
ferguson
had
tapped
him
up
when
he
was
at
psv
defender
because
the
transfer
fee
was
too
good
to
refuse
for
a
player
past
his
i
had
even
just
ordered
a
new
kitchen
but
they
wanted
to
sell
me
he
good
employee
be
ushered
out
the
door
against
their
wishes
of
course
you
can
refuse
to
go
but
then
the
club
have
the
power
to
put
you
on
the
the

in
the

position
than

we
are

of

by
nine
points
and
in

they
are
in
a
better
position
than
us
in
is
the

teams
can
either
go

go

the
one
team
that
is
in
the
best

is
still
chelseamourinho
said
it
was
important
to
keep
his

results
in

because
i
am
never
under
pressure
he
this

at

i
dont

asked

replied
i
have
had
thisisanumber
years
of
honeymoons
with
my
not
happy
with
me
is
the
day
that
i
the

should
follow
the

of

and
have
a

break

insists
that
a

domestic
schedule
will
not
damage
the

bid
for

stavanger
was
at

with

at

on

as
a
member
of

technical
the
winter
break
employed
throughout
europe
although
not
in
england
where
the
champions
league
contenders
have
ploughed
through
a
heavy
fixture
while
he
believes
the
premiership
should
embrace
the
idea
he
does
not
expect
it
to
cost
the
english
representatives
in
the
last
thisisanumber
of
the
champions
difficult
to
say
with
certainty
that
teams
who
have
had
the
break
will
have
a
definite
the
recharge
their
batteries
midway
through
the
season
which
some
suggest
will
give
teams
an
advantage
in
the
champions
having
a
break
then
coming
back
to
it
puts
you
at
a
break
should
be
to
do
with
the
nature
of
football
today
the
needs
of
football
players
and
the
way
the
premiership
has
developed
rather
than
one
or
two
matches
in
the
champions
league
in
february
hodgson
believes
a
winter
break
carries
many
advantages
explaining
as
i
said
it
is
the
perfect
chance
to
recharge
a
manager
in
england
i
would
be
supporting
any
calls
for
its
of
enthusiasm
and
energy
but
by
the
time
you
get
towards
christmas
many
players
having
also
played
plenty
of
international
matches
for
club
and
country
and
travelled
a
lot
find
themselves
getting
very
to
recover
that
energy
and
enthusiasm
and
perhaps
more
importantly
recover
their
mental
strength
during
the
break
and
get
ready
for
the
games
the
most
important
thing
hodgson
added
the
length
of
breaks
can
do
or
thisisanumber
days
off
then
you
were
training
for
a
week
or
thisisanumber
days
and
then
went
into
a
important
those
responsible
for
physical
fitness
give
the
players
a
programme
to
follow
to
ensure
the
physical
strength
they
have
accumulated
stays
with
them
and
hodgson
believes
a
winter
break
would
be
a
positive
step
in
the
football
at
elite
level
which
the
premiership
is
then
i
would
support
a
winter
the
premier
league
and
in
particular
on
players
who
play
international
football
for
their
club
and
country
then
a
break
would
do

unable
to

because
oleary

a
shortage
of
vassell

the

has
alleviated

italian
striker

with
ljungberg

they
were
almost

behind

his

left

with

of

he
blazed
over

all
a

has
a

breaking
a

against

last
thisisanumber
march
having
lost
thisisanumber
in
the
first
it
is
not
impossible
that
i
will
play
against
barcelona
but
it
is
just
a
very
very
small
chance
about
thisisanumber
has
been
an
inspirational
player
for
chelsea
this
season
following
a
switch
from
psv
einhoven
last
better
than
we
expected
a
few
weeks
ago
but
i
think
the
barcelona
game
will
come
too
come
back
too
that
he
has
had
no
contact
with
chelsea
over
the
inquiries
about

thisisanumber
brazilian
de

i
can
assure
you
that

it

if

kept

they

i
really

they
have

to
the
great
it
is
just
a
tough
league
to
stay
in

they
are
finding
out

as
we
with
steve
gerrard
to
reject
any
overtures
from
that
any
honours
won
at
chelsea
would
be
cheapened
by
the
bid
to
buy
liverpool
would
think
about
any
bid
made
but
it
will
all
be
down
to
steve
in
the
sweet
feeling
at
chelsea
where
its
all
moneyorientated
and
about
simply
buying
the
best
thompson
reacted
sharply
to
some
liverpool
supporters
who
criticised
gerrards
performance
in
the
carling
cup
final
against
commitment
and
sarcastically
branded
his
own
goal
in
liverpools
thisisanumber
defeat
as
his
first
goal
for
from
socalled
supporters
and
they
were
diabolical
absolutely
and
this
who
savoured
seven
titlewinning
seasons
and
two
european
cup
triumphs
during
his
anfield
playing
career
is
confident
that
the
lure
of
champions
league
football
will
keep
gerrard
at
beckon
for
liverpool
either
as
winners
or
as
finishing
fourth
in
the
premiership
and
he
will
commit
soulsearching
the
way
things
have
gone
fact
he
will
have
big
decisions
to
make
but
i
hope
it
is
to
the
benefit
of
steven
gerrard

i
hope
it
is
worthwhile

it
hasnt
this
is
the
opportunity

good
for

no

overall
discipline
during

on

it
was
only
his

that
got
him
first
for

they
handled

then
they
do

all
the

signing

mutu
once
the

has
served
his
drugs
friday
after
testing
positive
for

a
move
wenger
has
wonder
if
that
could
happen
because
i
think
he
will
be
suspended
for
a
long
suspension
he
has
the
right
again
to
start
from
and
see
what
he
tells
me
mutu
faces
a
ban
of
between
six
months
and
two
years
when
the
football
association
decides
on
his
case
was
heard
and
sacked
the
striker
on
grounds
of
gross
misconduct
after
it
was
revealed
that
he
had
failed
a
drug
the
clubs
decision
saying
chelsea
have
destroyed
me
he
told
the
sunday

i
dont
know
what
im
going
to
their
me
while
i
was
suspended
but
i
never
thought
they
would
sack
me
this
now
my

for
their

with

the

of
failing

that
anelka

i
either
decide
to
win

or
to
have
an
easy
football
if
a
great
club
makes
me
an

he
added
to

you
need
players
who
have
the
capability
of
doing
thisisanumber
place
its
impossible
to
goals
and
not
win
there
is
a
risk
it
is
going
to
create
a
feeling
of
being
fed
up
anelka
has
earned
a
reputation
for
being
a
difficult
character
to
handle
after
spells
at
arsenal
real
madrid
and
paris
st
germain
and
he
feels
that
is
now
coming
back
to
haunt
an
extension
to
my
contract
he
sporting
aspect
also
comes
into
but
i
miss
the
champions
in
thisisanumber
and
i
need
to
be
playing
in
it
and
i
should
be
playing
in
things
that
have
happened
in
the
past
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
denied
that
coach
jacques
santini
resigned
because
of
a
clash
of
personalities
at
white
hart
santini
had
felt
undermined
by
arnesens
role
at
the
told
bbc
radio
five
made
him
resign
and
that
is
his
own
personal
and
said
this
matter
is
absolutely
for
himself
arnesen
said
he
was
unable
to
throw
any
light
onto
the
problems
that
caused
santini
to
quit
after
just
thisisanumber
games
in
into
exactly
what
it
you
have
to
accept
the
weekend
we
will
have
talks
with
the
board
and
then
on
monday
we
will
clarify
the
situation
arnesen
countered
criticism
at
the
timing
of
the
announcement
coming
less
than
thisisanumber
hours
before
tottenhams
premiership
fixture
with
problems
i
dont
think
we
should
talk
about
timing
he
santini
had
been
given
a
thisisanumber
i
will
go
and
so
he
went
said
the
spurs
sporting
director
working
alongside
a
coach
is
based
on
a
continental
model
and
arnesen
sees
no
reason
why
they
should
change
started
something
here
in
july
and
i
still
have
a
lot
of
confidence
in
tottenham
and
what
we
are
doing
he
gary
stevens
said
he
would
not
be
surprised
if
the
system
had
caused
a
lot
deeper
between
the
director
of
football
at
white
hart
lane
and
santini
stevens
told
five
creative
forwardthinking
and
expansive
player
whereas
i
think
santini
was
very
much
the
opposite
more
a
case
of
being
organised
disciplined
and
happy
not
conceding
if
the
two
people
have
the
same
principles
and
ideals
and
work
very
be
the
perfect
choice
to
succeed
berti
vogts
as
scotland
hot
favourite
to
take
over
from
vogts
who
resigned
on
candidate
for
that
told
bbc
tommy
burns
as
provisional
caretakerboss
for
the
friendly
against
sweden
on
thisisanumber
his
knowledge
and
understanding
of
the
scotland
team
and
successful
souness
added
walter
is
a
real
football
person
as
i
know
from
working
with
him
at
is
a
proper
human
being
who
would
command
the
instant
respect
of
the
players
and
everyone
involved
in
scottish
football
souness
joined
sir
alex
ferguson
in
backing
smiths
to
embark
on
the
search
for
vogts
successor
after
appointing
tommy
burns
in
a
caretaker
the
outstanding
candidate
as
far
as
im
theyre
doing
and
walter
would
bring
a
wealth
of
experience
to
the
job
the
man
utd
boss
continued
i
dont
know
what
credentials
are
needed
to
do
the
job
but
its
a
job
that
needs
a
lot
of
and
here
at
manchester
united
and
he
has
also
managed
glasgow
whole
shape
of
scottish
football
and
radical
changes
are
needed
smith
was
assistant
to
ferguson
at
the
world
cup
in
mexico
in
has
been
out
of
the
game
since
a
spell
as
manchester
united
assistant
last
be
willing
to
discuss
taking
over
if
he
was
approached
by
the
scottish
over
it
seems
almost
certain
smiths
longtime
righthand
man
archie
knox
would
also
play
a
part
in
the
national
team
many
pundits
and
fans
including
former
scotland
manager
craig
candidate
without
and
i
got
the
impression
he
would
take
and
i
was
positive
other
candidates
for
the
job
include
former
scotland
midfielders
gordon
strachan
and
gary
mcallister
and
vogts
assistant
tommy
battle
it
out
with
arsenal
for
the
premiership
in
the
coming
the
way
to
the
end
of
the
season
because
we
are
both
going
to
give
it
everything
he
told
bbc
you
need
a
lot
of
but
it
will
be
as
hard
for
the
arsenal
players
as
it
is
for
the
chelsea
boys
we
know
that
we
have
got
the
power
in
our
hands
just
now
added
going
to
happen
in
football
two
seasons
ago
manchester
united
picked
up
so
many
points
towards
the
end
of
the
season
when
they
won
the
come
second
but
you
never
know
what
happens
in
first
as
much
as
every
arsenal
player
will
be
challenging
to
come
first
gallas
has
been
given
extra
confidence
by
the
impact
manager
jose
mourinho
has
had
since
taking
over
as
manager
during
the
mourinho
is
perfectly
suited
to
boss
the
squad
of
chelsea
stars
and
says
his
managerial
expertise
will
prevent
any
player
got
a
team
put
together
of
such
big
names
that
you
put
the
finishing
touch
to
it
and
the
finishing
touch
at
chelsea
is
a
fantastic
manager
like
mourinho
he
cake
at
the
thinking
of
is
that
every
player
even
though
the
fans
may
consider
them
to
be
a
stars
within
the
dressingroom
they
are
absolutely
have
to
because
he
has
created
a
wonderful
atmosphere
where
everybody
is
playing
and
laughing
every
the
atmosphere
there

he

up

he
would
have
did

to
throw

back
when
it
went
out

and
many
will
delight

the

with

appear
to
have
paid
well
above
the
odds
for
last
week
tevez
was
not
even
an
especially
big
name
in
brazil
where
the
argentine
championship
is
not
behind
the
is
why
tevez
should
be
interested
in
heading
north
rather
than
across
the
form
in
august
as
he
spearheaded
the
charge
towards
the
olympic
gold
been
easy
for
to
vacate
his
favoured

gave
up
on
him
after
declaring
his
private
life
to
be
disorganized
hounded
by
the
press
tevez
grew
tired
of
his
life
in
buenos
is
heading
for
corinthians
in
search
of
tranquillity
anyone
acquainted
with
the

will
relish

that
unless
he
did
something
special
the
corinthians
fans
were
capable
of
winning
the
game
on
their
against
the

especially
nowadays
when
the

gives
a
hysterical
edge

an

waste
of
his
towns
on
poor
pitches
with
plenty
of
defenders
keen
to
kick
him
all
the
way
back
to
south
american
players
tevez
has
the
gift
of
being
able
to
surprise
to
feint
right
and
go
left
to
pass
when
he
was
expected
to
dribble
to
shoot
and
catch
the
goalkeeper
the
biggest
surprise
of
out
at
the
club
for
stalling
over
offering
him
a
new
he
has
been
linked
with
spanish
trio
real
madrid
barcelona
and
sure
if
i
want
to
stay
or
not
because
the
club
have
let
the
situation
go
on
this
sign
they
should
have
come
up
with
an
offer
six
months
before
indicating
they
wanted
to
sign
me
and
thats
made
me
think
edus
brother
and
representative
amadeo
fensao
has
previously
said
that
arsenals
current
offer
to
the
midfielder
was
well
short
of
what
he
was
is
due
to
come
to
london
on
thisisanumber
or
thisisanumber
january
to
sort
it
out
with
stay
or
as
soon
as
possible
thats
in
the
best
interests
of
both
the
club
and
after
the
meeting
later
this
week
edu
is
now
able
to
begin
negotiations
with
other
clubs
because
fifa
regulations
allow
players
to
start
talks
six
months
before
their
contracts
the
brazilian
national
side
in
thisisanumber
admitted
he
had
been
flattered
to
have
been
linked
with
the
three
spanish
from
the
news
that
the
madrid
president
florentino
perez
the
valencia
people
as
well
as
barcelona
are
to
them
so
i
cant
say
they
want
me
sign
thisisanumber
last
month
wenger
said
he
we
was
hopeful
edu
would
sign
a
new
deal
and
played
down
suggestions
that
the
lure
of
a
club
like
real
madrid
would
be
too
strong
for
encouraged
by
wengers

revealed
on
thursday
when
walter
smith
was
named

the

tenure
in

of
scotland
ended
the
former
rangers
and
everton
boss
has
been
the
overwhelming
favourite
for
the
what
must
be
one
of
the
hardest
jobs
in
football
the
thisisanumber
takes
over
at
a
time
when
the
national
side
is
in
the
finals
since
the
world
cup
in
thisisanumber
and
reaching
germany
thisisanumber
looks
near
impossible
having
picked
up
just
two
points
from
the
opening
three
games
in
the
qualifying
listed
at
an
all
time
low
of
thisisanumber
below
the
likes
of
estonia
ghana
angola
and
players
with
experience
at
the
top
level
so
smith
will
have
to
get
the
best
out
of
meagre
and
he
is
widely
respected
within
the
assistant

scotland
played

from

never

when
he

a

experience
the

that
blighted
so
much
of

imperative
and
smith
is
widely
regarded
as

to
the
home
team
with
jaime
vargas
lauding
the
manner
in
which
spain
dominated
england
with

and
about
spain
v
england
was
that
it
lasted
only
thisisanumber
minutes

a
succession

prevented
any

competition
vargas
does
not
mention
englands
two
galacticos
simply
adding
in
a
ps
i
have
not
forgotten
to
speak
of
beckham
and
admitted
he
was
frustrated
his
side
did
not
score
more
than
one
goal
in
their
friendly
win
over
to
thisisanumber
with
a
firsthalf
goal
which
proved
enough
for
did
not
take
them
against
such
a
technically
gifted
team
said
standard
of
the
croatian
team
we
should
be
very
happy
with
the
win
the
republic
side
kept
a
clean
sheet
for
the
eighth
time
in
thisisanumber
matches
and
are
unbeaten
in
thisisanumber
home
games
since
kerr
succeeded
mick
earned
the
skill
by
damien
little
but
it
was
a
good
goal
matchwinner
keane
was
another
full
of
praise
for
duffs
role
in
the
said
the
tottenham
around
because
you
know
nine
times
out
of
thisisanumber
duffer
is
going
to
get
it
in
the
out
and
it
was
good
to
see
young
stephen
elliott
getting
a
did
well
and
is
definitely
one
for
the
players
coming
through
manofthematch
duff
explained
what
went
wrong
when
he
fluffed
a
chance
to
make
it
thisisanumber
midway
through
the
second
cross
down
and
shoot
against
the
bar
when
a
closerange
header
looked
the
best
time
but
i
completely
lost
it
in
the
lights
said
the
chelsea
the
scoresheet
myself
but
the
result
is
the
important
and
are
going
nicely
in
the
position
at
the
premiership
summit
proves
that
they
now
have
everything
in
place
to
mount
serious
challenges
on
all
fronts
this
great
players
an
outstanding
manager
in
jose
mourinho
and
finances
no
other
club
in
the
world
can
is
the
big
prizes
which
as
we
all
know
is
the
most
difficult
part
of
put
themselves
in
a
position
to
make
that
leap
to
success
very
impressively
at
stamford
bridge
won
at
newcastle
in
the
carling
cup
and
then
won
thisisanumber
at
fulham
which
was
a
great
result
given
that
they
had
been
showing
good
honours
is
the
hardest
task
of
all
but
in
mourinho
they
have
a
manager
who
will
make
it
a
whole
lot
easier
to
handle
the
anticipation
and
expectation
that
will
come
their
way
prize
of
all
the
champions
league
and
that
track
record
and
confidence
transmits
itself
to
top
highlyimpressed
by
arrogant
by
some
people
and
maybe
he
can
appear
that
way
but
he
has
the
silverware
to
back
up
the
game
hes
won
some
very
big
games
such
as
the
champions
league
final
with
the
words
are
backed
up
with
very
realistic
whenever
ive
heard
and
it
seems
to
be
working
and
we
should
remember
lots
of
managers
have
spent
money
and
it
has
not
in
arjen
robben
he
has
the
player
who
is
giving
them
that
extra
slaughtered
for
defensive
tactics
and
yet
he
was
winning
in
the
season
but
you
can
certainly
lose
them
and
those
points
on
the
board
were
very
harsh
because
even
though
they
were
not
scoring
goals
they
were
creating
chances
by
the
have
the
double
threat
of
robben
and
damien
duff
and
things
are
looking
a
predator
particularly
with
didier
drogba
part
before
he
was
sidelined
but
you
have
to
feel
if
chelsea
had
a
ruud
van
nistelrooy
they
would
be
even
more
of
a
safe
bet
for
the
to
go
far
in
the
champions
a
better
chance
than
last
season
but
they
have
swept
all
before
them
in
europe
so
far
this
to
see
how
mourinho
prioritises
things
but
his
life
will
be
made
easier
by
the
size
of
chelseas
would
win
the
league
this
season
even
when
arsenal
were
flying
at
the
start
and
i
have
seen
nothing
to
make
me
change
me
has
confirmed
my
early
from
arsenals
rocky
defensive
display
at
spurs
even
though
they
ran
out
thisisanumber
game
complaining
fivefour
is
a
hockey
score
not
a
football
the
score
reaches
thisisanumber
i
send
the
players
back
to
the
dressing
rooms
as
they
are
not
defending
that
in
a
game
of
thisisanumber
against
thisisanumber
is
disgracefulon
a
more
serious
note
it
was
a
game
that
merely
confirmed
the
importance
of
sol
campbell
to
pascal
cygan
but
i
believe
the
problem
lies
with
the
absence
of
campbell
and
its
overall
effect
on
arsenals
suddenly
get
a
chill
in
the
bones
every
time
the
ball
comes
into
the
penalty
your
worst
fears
with
or
without
campbell
and
get
some
clean
sheets
on
the
and
is
powerful
in
the
air
and
on
the
a
calming
influence
on
all
around
the
back
and
gets
the
defence
playing
as
a
present
which
is
why
i
would
still
place
my
money
on
them
to
edge
out
arsenal
as
champions
this
all
ghanaian

couple
of
important
goals
early
i
was
delighted
with
all
the
players
curbishley
was
subjected
to
criticism
from
charlton
fans
recently
and
he
said
the
thing
about
this
club
is
that
we
have
got
where
we
are
by
all
pulling
in
the
same
been
here
and
we
dont
want
people
taking
be
considered
slight
favourites
for
the
old
firm
cis
cup
clash
but
insists
his
side
can
still
form
at
the
moment
but
they
have
failed
to
beat
celtic
in
their
last
seven
have
been
on
a
good
run
in
recent
weeks
he
were
capable
of
winning
if
we
play
our
best
he
told
the
evening
to
it
because
they
are
brilliant
games
to
be
involved
our
game
we
have
still
been
winning
the
top
of
the
league
and
still
in
with
a
chance
of
staying
in
europe
so
i
dont
think
it
is
the
crisis
people
have
been
trying
to
make
when
you
are
losing
goals
because
we
have
been
notorious
for
being
a
team
that
is
hard
to
beat
and
keeping
clean
sheets
but
hopefully
we
are
over
that
wee
the
end
of
last
season
we
have
still
been
scoring
a
lot
of
goals
which
is
the
way
his
side
have
got
to
grips
with
european
football
after
the
thisisanumber
uefa
cup
win
against
for
the
first
time
in
their
thisisanumber
history
are
top
of
group
e
with
maximum
europe
really
well
said
them
settle
or
and
looked
threatening
every
time
we
went
forward
before
the
match
mcclaren
had
said
that
a
win
over
the
italian
giants
would
put
boro
firmly
on
the
european
footballing
he
said
it
was
a
perfect
european
fans
a
performance
like
that
was
the
icing
on
the
but
this
was
something
we
have
in
the
squad
is
to
defend
well
and
we
have
done
that
because
we
have
conceded
only
one
goal
in
four
again
that
is
something
you
can
see
from
the
performances
we
have
had
so
we
have
good
was
that
their
dominance
should
have
been
resulted
in
more
said
recent
weeks
and
i
saw
them
score
a
late
equaliser
against
inter
milan
on
saturday
so
i
knew
we
needed
a
second
are
favourites
to
win
this
competition
middlesbrough
forward
boudewijn
zenden
said
he
did
not
expect
such
a
comfortable
match
after
he
scored
both
that
onesided
said
first
half
we
pressured
them
and
they
didnt
cope
with
and
it
was
a
very
good
game
especially
in
the
first
half
the
holland
international
said
boro
are
confident
of
progressing
in
the
competition
after
winning
their
first
two
group
there
is
a
good
spirit
all
the
lads
work
hard
for
each
other
and
its
a
squad
of
friendly
players
which
i
think
you
can
see
on
the
pitch
he
against
deportivo
la
coruna
was
vital
in
their
tight
champions
league
liverpool
a
thisisanumber
a
very
high
tempo
and
had
many
for
us
and
we
could
have
scored
more
also
good
on
the
counter
to
the
next
game
igor
biscan
was
outstanding
in
midfield
after
replacing
injured
xabi
alonso
and
benitez
said
he
played
very
the
players
ready
and
a
good
squad
so
you
can
play
more
games
at
a
high
level
benitez
added
it
is
all
back
in
our
own
hands
now
it
was
a
great
win
for
us
and
i
was
delighted
with
what
i
feel
was
the
best
liverpool
i
have
winning
in
spain
that
is
really
not
away
matches
in
the
champions
league
that
it
was
in
spain
was
not
my
first
it
is
important
for
liverpool
to
win
it
is
not
important
in
what
country
it
is
in
benitez
added
benitez
said
we
had
a
problem
before
the
start
it
was
decided
that
xabi
could
not
play
more
than
thisisanumber
the
way
that
dietmar
hamann
and
igor
biscan
performed
we
did
not
need
to
change
things
until
right
at
the
end
of
the
if
you
allow
them
to
keep
possession
they
can
be
very
dangerous
hit
them
on
the
counterattack
it
would
make
them
nervous
and
that
is
how
it
worked
out
deportivo
coach
javier
irureta
said
liverpool
played
very
well
and
we
just
could
not
break
them
six
games
at
home
in
europe
without
scoring
but
that
does
not
reflect
our
overall
play
well
and
we
lacked
and
a
big
blow
to
our
at
that
stage
did
not
want
the
group
but
as
long
as
there
is
hope
of
qualifying
we
will
hang
on
to
to
thisisanumber

the
season
as

then
taking
up

an

after
the
thisisanumber
world
cup
when
he
made
controversial
remarks
about
the

in
a

with
southampton
where
he
again
succeeded
jones

he
has
now
done
at

being
lured
to
white
hart
lane
by
tottenham
the
club
where
he
made
his

as
a
start
of
the
last
campaign
and
he
left
the
london
club
early
last
for
the
post
of
france
manager
and
had
also
been
linked
with
a
return
to

and
have
a
home
game
against
millwall
on
faith
with
standin
keeper
manuel
almunia
for
the
crunch
week
which
could
define
arsenals

tie
against
rosenborg

is
likely
to
face
chelsea

take
out
one
goalkeeper
for
just
one
game
do
you
i
dont
do
run
for
a
few
to
make
this
story
bigger
than
it
is
wenger
insists
he
has
complete
faith
in
the
thisisanumber
spaniard
who
was
signed
last
summer
from
celta
vigo
as
backup
to
jens
you
will
see
that
i
have
left
many
big
players
out
for
a
long
kanu
no
matter
who
it
big
mistake
at
old
trafford
and
i
wasnt
alarmed
by
what
happened
against
birmingham
as
is
have
good
periods
and
less
good
two
or
three
weeks
or
longer
or
shorter
it
doesnt
mean
ive
lost
faith
in
himbut
former
arsenal
keeper
david
seaman
believes
lehmann
has
been
harshly
is
a
fantastic
but
on
form
he
deserves
to
be
the
firstteam
choice
with
arsenal
hit
by
injuries
and
suspension
inexperienced
midfield
pair
of
mathieu
flamini
and
cesc
fabregas
will
line
up
against
rosenborg
but
wenger
is
confident
they
will
prove
more
than
on
them
but
its
a
good
learning
process
said
both
mentally
strong
and
will
put
in
the
needed
workratethe
gunners
go
into
the
game
boosted
by
the
news
that
defender
sol
campbell
is
on
the
verge
of
signing
a
new
deal
with
the
runs
out
in
the
summer
has
made
it
clear
he
is
determined
to
achieve
champions
league
success
with
to
me
to
go
through
its
this
europe
these
guys
and
trying
to
win
the
trophy
is
the
first
thing
in
my
mindmeanwhile
thierry
henry
believes
he
will
be
blamed
if
arsenal
fail
to
qualify
for
the
next
stage
of
the

place
of
the
suspended
patrick

as
the
gunners
seek
the
required
victory
over
dont
win
and
we
go
out
of
the
competition
like
it
or
not
its
going
to
be
my
know
i
will
be
criticised
no
matter
how
i
praised
the
work
of
his
anfield
successor
rafael
he
has
been
critical
of
benitez
since
the
spaniard
took
over
at
private
and
in
public
i
have
stressed
i
believe
rafa
is
doing
a
good
the
right
a
good
has
been
at
liverpool
and
never
criticised
him
houllier
also
revealed
he
is
now
ready
to
return
to
the
game
after
leaving
liverpool
in
may
following
six
years
at
linked
with
a
host
of
jobs
and
pulled
out
of
the
race
to
succeed
mark
hughes
as
wales
national
covering
the
premiership
for
french
television
and
also
coaching
in
brazil
with
national
coach
carlos
alberto
comes
up
at
the
right
time
then
yes
i
am
ready
to
come
games
from
a
different
perspective
and
i
have
learned
since
leaving
liverpool
and
my
batteries
are
rechargedhoullier
has
been
impressed
with
the
quality
in
the
premiership
after
watching
as
a
pundit
particularly
with
jose
mourinhos
work
at
leaders
players
in
damien
duff
and
arjen
robben
and
didier
drogba
showed
he
can
change
the
face
of
a
game
when
he
came
on
against
spirit
and
are
strong
with
all
the
pressure
put
on
them
because
of
the
expectations
and
cope
well
with
joses
to
chelsea
and
i
think
he
will
have
an
impact
in
the
premiership
because
he
manages
his
team
very
cleverly
and
houllier
away
from
his
brief
at
liverpool
has
been
hugely
impressed
with
the
exciting
and
teams
are
always
trying
to
watch
the
game
from
a
different
is
more
pace
to
the
premiership
than
other
side
can
clinch
a
topfour
spot
in
the
premiership
and
secure
qualification
for
the
champions

mcclaren
said
we
are
playing
exciting
football
its
a
magnificent
result
to
keep
us
in
the
top
how
often
we
can
get
our
best
team
it
should
have
been
four
or
five
but
we
nearly
paid
for
it
in
the
end
mcclaren
also
praised
winger
stewart
downing
and
strikers
jimmy
floyd
hasselbaink
and
mark
viduka
who
both
ended
barren
runs

walked
down

tunnel
together
at

we
are
not

action
over
and
we
have
decided
that
no
further
action
is
mourinho
was
concerned
that
fergusons
conversation
with
barry
was
followed
by
an
inconsistent
display
by
the
first
half
and
another
in
the
second
said

i
will
tell
it
easier
to
understand
a

been
managing
in
the

league
for
thisisanumber
years
and
have
the
respect
of
everybody
i
will
have
the
power
to
speak
to
people
and
make
them
tremble
a
little
one
way
during
the
first
half
but
in
the
second
they
had
dozens
of
after
not
walk
to
the
dressing
rooms
alone
at
two
assistants
and
the
fourth
official
with
him
but
there
was
also
someone
else
referees
chief
keith
hackett
believes
mourinho
should
retract
his
comments
about
ferguson
and
barry
as
he
believes
the
blues
boss
has
questioned
their
comments
unfortunately
this
is
the
nature
of
the
game
said
getting
in
the
psychological
warfare
between
two
an
experienced
referee
and
we
should
be
talking
about
the
quality
of
that
game
rather
than
the
and
i
note
that
but
a
referees
integrity
has
been
questioned
that
is
offensive
and
should
be
facts
mourinho
added
that
the
match
was
entertaining
for
a
goalless
draw
and
insisted
his
team
could
still
reach
the
we
go
through
and
if
we
get
a
draw
we
go
to
extra
time
he
we
had
before
this
result
but
we
know
what
manchester

hayward
revealed
that
hoddle
was
one
of
the
first
to
be
approached

on
saturday
when
ferguson
said
his
arsenal
counterpart
was
a
saying
only
i
will
never
answer
any
questions
any
more
about
this
man
but
now
he
claims
ferguson
should
be
punished
by
the
football
saga
came
on
saturday
when
the
united
boss
in
an
interview
with
the
independent
newspaper
discussed
the
events
after
the
game
between
the
two
sides
in
old
trafford
but
the
game
was
followed
by
a
now
notorious
food
fight
which
saw
fergusons
clothes
covered
in
soup
and
on
thisisanumber
my
players
calling
them
cheats
so
i
told
him
to
leave
them
alone
and
behave
himself
ferguson
said
on
raised
saying
what
do
you
want
to
do
about
it
to
not
apologise
for
the
behaviour
of
the
players
to
another
manager
is
expect
wenger
to
ever
apologise
hes
that
type
of
personthose
allegations
were
put
to
wenger
after
saturdays
game
at
bolton
which
arsenal
lost
to
slip
thisisanumber
points
behind
chelsea
in
the
title
always
been
consistent
with
that
story
and
told
you
nothing
newspaper
article
he
makes
a
newspaper
matter
to
me
at
provocation
from
him
any
england
and
see
how
it
is
but
later
on
saturday
according
to
the
independent
wenger
spoke
to
a
smaller
group
of
reporters
and
expanded
on
his
him
the
arsenal
boss
is
quoted
as
he
does
what
he
wants
and
you
the
press
are
all
at
his
has
been
judged
and
there
is
a
game
going
on
in
a
protect
the
game
before
the
punished
for
what
you
say
after
the
i
love
football
above
that
ferguson
called
him
a
disgrace
wenger
added
i
dont
respond
to
a
game
it
is
as
well
before
a
gameferguson
had
also
claimed
that
united
chief
executive
david
gill
and
arsenal
vicechairman
david
dein
had
agreed
at
boardroom
level
not
to
discuss
the
incident
in
weeks
all
you
got
was
a
diatribe
from
arsenal
about
being
kicked
off
the
pitch
and
all
that
complain
but
nothing
was
and
they
will
come
out
with
another
should
set
the
record
straight
because
arsenal
have
not
written
to
us
to
apologise
and
we
would
not
let
that
happen
here
meanwhile
the
league
managers
association
have
offered
to
act
as
peacemakers
in
the
hope
of
resolving
the
ongoing
united
striker
ruud
van
nistelrooy
caught
arsenals
ashley
cole
with
one
particularly
strong
cheating
and
was
fined
thisisanumber
and
severely
reprimanded
by
the
football
nistelrooys
tackle
which
earned
the
dutchman
a
ban
could
have
given
cole
a
serious
injury
but
he
believes
arsenal
were
the
main
was
not
played
in
the
right
spirit
he
all
time
they
dont
know
how
to
they
dont
lose
many
games
to
other
disciplinary
record
of
all
time
was
arsenals
up
until
last
now
they
are
seen
as
paragons
of
it
is
all
some
dream
or
qualification
for
the
next
stage
of
the
champions
league
was
one
of
the
proudest
nights
of
my
careerthe
reds
beat
olympiakos
thisisanumber
with
a
late
steven
gerrard
strike
and
benitez
said
it
was
a
really
great
time
and
you
see
how
much
it
means
to
the
it
was
very
important
for
the
club
to
gain
these
extra
very
important
benitez
hailed
gerrard
for
his
matchwinning
strike
four
minutes
from
time
and
also
the
anfield
crowd
for
sticking
by
their
side
after
they
had
fallen
a
goal
behind
at
the
in
a
sensational
comeback
capped
by
gerrards
thisisanumber
over
the
pitch
and
he
influences
every
part
of
the
times
that
he
has
the
freedom
because
he
has
talent
and
is
very
important
to
the
sides
was
really
our
supporters
i
cannot
thank
them
the
supporters
they
were
magnificent
to
help
us
achieve
this
result
gerrard
admitted
he
thought
they
were
going
out
of
the
champions
league
after
trailing
thisisanumber
at
i
thought
we
were
going
through
when
we
were
losing
at
but
we
have
climbed
it
and
credit
to
goals
i
have
scored
i
caught
it
sweet
i
havent
caught
one
like
that
for
me
and
the
team

that
you

to
so
while
i
am
disappointed
at
the
result
i
am
not
at
the

i
young
time
they
come
they
will
be

ferguson
admitted
his
side

wellbeaten
by
the

a
result
which
meant
they

admitted
another

would
not
be
tolerated
at

its
a
relief
for
the

to
have
we
cannot
afford
to
to
go
another
season
without
winning
anything
reals
finish

chelsea
who
won
their
respective
we

even
if

past

in
their
third
round
the
ball
between
paul
jones
legs
after
just
nine
to
make
it
safe
as
jones
made
some
great
saves
but
wayne
rooney
put
the
tie
beyond
doubt
late
on
with
a
cool
sean
devine
twice
volleying
wide
and
andrew
taylor
forcing
tim
howard
to
taking
few
chances
after
their
thisisanumber
draw
in

he
handed
starts
to
paul
scholes
and
ryan
as
well
as
ronaldo
and
steve
flack
seeing
plenty
of
the
ball
but
it
did
not
take
united
long
to
assert
their
authority
and
the
hosts
soon
found
themselves
a
goal
to
ronaldo
on
the
lefthand
side
of
the
sixyard
box
and
the
portuguese
winger
slid
the
ball
between
the
legs
of
jones
to
open
the
the
tie
as
a
contest
early
on
and
ronaldo
blazed
over
before
jones
saved
well
from
scholes
and
then
incessant
and
rooney
had
another
shot
blocked
while
ronaldo
slammed
well
over
the
bar
again
from

a
golden
chance
to
double
the

the
welshman
dragged
a

badly
wide
from

chance
as
alex
jeannin
swung
in
a
cross
from

that
devine
managed
to
flick
goalwards
but
the
ball
flew
wide

in
determined
fashion
and
howard
had
to
show
safe
hands
to
collect
two
searching

into
the

sealed
the
result
with
a

from

chelsea
will
renew
their
bid
to
lure
him
from

with
the

his
superb

winner
on

go
gerrard
scored
a
spectacular
late
goal
to
give
liverpool
a
thisisanumber
win
over
olympiakos
and
book
their
place
in
the

so
are
we
parry
can
satisfy
his
ambition
he
will
remain
a
liverpool
and
that
played
a
big
part
in
his
decision
to
stay
last
to
liverpool
he
would
have
gone
by
now
gerrard
had
said
before
wednesdays
game
he
would
consider
leaving
if
the
club
was
knocked
out
of
europe
with
real
madrid
also
believed
to
be

his
is
i
want
to
be
in
a
liverpool
side
which
challenges
for
the
champions
league
and
the
title
all
the
time
he
said
with
liverpool
not
somewhere
and
i
think
what
i
have
said
the
supporters
will
agree
like
that
not
just
settle
for
a
great
win
and
then
not
progress
any
most
important
i
have
ever
scored
and
i
hope
it
turns
out
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
for
the
club
for
a
long
of
pressure
on
myself
because
of
what
i
said
and
i
felt
i
needed
a
big
performance
but
i
am
not
going
to
go
around
telling
lies
about
how
i
feelreds
manager
rafael
benitez
believes
gerrard
can
win
everything
he
wants
to
without

we
need
a
good

and
we
can
do
more
things
in
the

said
more

important
games
we
need
steven
in
the
mentality
he
has
and
his
the
responsibility
of
leading
this
admitted
he
would
like
to
succeed
kevin
keegan
as
manager
at
manchester
as
city
manager
when
his
contract
comes
to
an
end
in

to
realise
there
will
be

job
available
at
a
really
good
club
pearce
told
bbc
it
although
whether
the
board
deem
me
good
enough
to
take
it
i
do
not
know
pearce
initially
joined
city
as
a
player
under
keegan
in
thisisanumber
before
becoming
part
of
the
coaching
following
the
departure
of
arthur
cox
last
year
as
playerboss
with
nottingham
forest
eight
seasons
ago
but
has
made
no
secret
of
his
desire
to
have
another
crack
at
the
job
at
oldham
and
keegan
has
stated
he
would
not
get
in
the
way
if
pearce
wanted
to
keen
to
wait
for
his
chance
at
will
have
been
here
for
five
years
so
at
least
they
will
have
had
a
good
look
at
me
and
they
are
aware
of
my
feelings
with
regard
to
being

it

for
anybody

he
paused

striking

for

put

the

asked

as
well
as
all
the

in
the

of

we

following
a
careerthreatening

future
to
manchester

after
turning
his

sack
by
city
boss
kevin
keegan
but
has
since
responded
with
impressive
performances
prompting
interest
from
other
the
defender
said
hopefully
something
will
be
sorted
out
as
soon
as

because
i
have
really
improved

here
newcastle

is
said
to
have

by

in

intention
to

but
the
important
thing
is
this
one
and
what
we
and
i
want
to
keep
that
going
keegan
is
expected
to
be
told
there
will
be
no
funds
to
bring
in
fresh
faces
in
keegan
who
ordered
the
defender
home
after
he
allegedly
turned
up
for
training
in
a
dishevelled
that
period
of
his
life
behind
him
and
said
ive
grown
up
a
lot
and
the
manager
sees
me
as
one
of
the
most
experienced
players
in
the
other
outfield
players
this
season
so
i
cant
be
regarded
as
being
a
kid
any
added
pressure
to
perform
and
apart
from
the
games
at
newcastle
and
middlesbrough
defensively
weve
done
quite
well

of

and
the

apologised
for
anything
that
might
have
been
mistakenly
taken
from
the
french
with
me
that
we
are
a
big

it

a
bid
of
substance

worth
taking
then
between
us
wed
nicolas
which
we
have
clear
out
so
it

put
him
in
the
shop
hes
just
signed
a
new
fouryear

i
dont
think
hed
do
that
unless

club
city

generate
some
looking
at
clubs
like
everton

bolton
to
see
how
they
have
been
dealing
in

he
said
in
response
to
souness
done
nothing
wrong
he
told
the
evening
am
out
of
here
the
difficult
relationship
between
souness
and
bellamy
boiled
over
at
the
weekend
and
has
led
to
a
war
of
words
in
the
about
the
background
to
the
bustup
was
strongly
denied
by
shepherd
who
accused
the
striker
of
cheating
the
straight
regarding
the
bellamy
situation
said
saying
his
hamstring
was
tight
on
friday
but
what
he
failed
to
reveal
was
that
he
had
told
other
members
of
the
squad
before
training
that
he
intended
to
feign
ordered
bellamy
to
attend
a
meeting
in
my
graeme
and
i
that
he
had
told
the
players
that
he
was
going
to
fake
an
injury
in
training
and
walk
to
apologise
to
his
teammates
for
his
in
the
action
taken
by
the
manager
at
the
weekend
which
i
fully
on
the
club
the
supporters
the
manager
and
his
own
i
consider
his
behaviour
to
be
totally
unacceptable
and
totally
unprofessionalbellamys
latest
outburst
would
appear
to
make
his
chances
of
a
firstteam
recall
player
would
not
be
sold
bellamy
insisted
he
had
no
intention
of
handing
in
a
transfer
think
for
one
minute
that
i
wouldnt
play
for
this
club
he
even
in
me
at
the
moment
but
id
never
ask
to
leave
this
know
i
couldnt
come
back
here
and
play
against
to
win
their
uefa
cup
group
by
beating
partizan
knockout
stages
alongside
partizan
and
villareal
at
the
expense
of
a
victory
which
would
mean
they
avoid
a
team
that
has
played
in
the
champions
league
in
fridays
thirdround
top
is
fantastic
but
it
is
going
to
be
a
tough
one
mcclaren
thought
it
was
the
toughest
group
of
them
all
and
so
it
has
semifinalists
and
partizan
have
fantastic
experience
in
the
business
in
the
first
two
in
a
great
position
and
it
has
been
a
fantastic
experience
playing

he

said
spurs

frank
position
we
have
been
looking
at
and
he
showed
so
much
talent
in
his
time
here
that
we
decided
to
take
in
talent
good
prospects
and
giving
them
a
place
at
tottenham
where
they
can
is
going
to
be
criticised
after
their
disastrous
uefa

exit
at
the
hands
of
auxerre
at
ibrox
on
we
were
in
pole
position
to
get
through

the
next
stage
but
we
blew
it
we
absolutely
blew
in
the
sand
we
know
we
are
going
to
get
a
lot
of
we
have
done
in
the
past
and
we
must
now
bounce
back
mcleish
admitted
his
teams
defending
was
amateurish
after
watching
them
lose
thisisanumber
to
guy
rouxs
french
give
ourselves
a
chance
losing
the
first
goal
from
our
own
half
gave
us
a
mountain
to
climb
and
we
never
created
the
same
kind
of
chances
as
we
did
in
the
first
the
a
threeandahalf
year

extension
on
thursday

villa

was
happy
to
secure
the

excellent
and
he
shares
the

in
taking
this

he
told

we
got
this
right
oleary
put
pen
to

after
deals
were
sorted
for
his
righthand
men
roy
aitken

steve
an

on

ahead
of
signing
his
new
aston

back
where
they
should
belong
and
im
up
for

in

there
were
rumours
oleary
would
quit
if
he
is
not
offered
a
new
deal
before
the
end
of
the
was
happy
to
take
on
the
challenge
of
improving
villas
fortunes
in
the
long
the
end
of
the
five
years
i
would
have
been
in
charge
that
villa
are
achieving
top
six
finishes
in
the
premiership
on
a
regular
basis
said
oleary
who
took
over
at
villa
park
in
may
the
next
step
forward
we
do
need
to
bring
in
quality
month
if
at
all
possible
to
set
us
on
the
way
meanwhile
oleary
has
rapped
skipper
olof
mellberg
for
his
comments
before
sundays
derby
with
villas
rivals
ahead
of
the
match
which
steve
bruces
side
won
word
with
group
not
as
a
onetoone
he
told
villas
be
shot
to
take
cheap
shots
at
you
and
he
set
himself
up
for
to
atletico
madrid
from
birmingham
months
at
st
andrews
following
a
thisisanumber
move
from
chelsea
in
july
after
playing
for
denmark
at
euro
the
january
transfer
window
in
a
deal
rumoured
to
be
about
thisisanumber
subject
to
a
representative
to
finalise
the
contract
and
decide
when
he
will
sign
said
atletico
sporting
director
toni
fans
and
was
sarcastically
applauded
when
taken
off
against
everton
last
he
would
be
happy
to
let
the
danish
international
go
if
the
price
was
say
the
decision
to
let
him
go
is
down
to
the
fans
reaction
towards
since
the
summer
with
the
loss
of
his
mother
and
finding
it
difficult
to
adjust
to
a
new
club
and
a
different
missed
a
days
training
and
is
someone
if
your
daughter
brought
them
home
you
would
be
here
for
most
of
what
we
bid
for
longtime
target
fernando
morientes
according
to
linked
with
a
move
to
anfield
since
the
summer
and
is
currently
behind
raul
ronaldo
and
michael
owen
at
the
to
bolster
his
forward
options
with
djibril
cisse
out
until
next
it
could
be
i
would
be
keen
to
leave
admitted
the
thisisanumber
control
of
the
they
will
make
any
decisions
the
fee
could
put
liverpool
off
a
prospective
deal
but
real
are
keen
to
net
the
cash
as
they
are
reported
to
be
preparing
a
massive
summer
bid
for
inter
milan
striker
the
premiership
thisisanumber
points
behind
leaders
place
in
the
knockout
stages
of
the
uefa
cup
could
help
keep
some
of
his
outofcontract
players
at
the
another
european
tie
it
may
encourage
players
to
stay
at
least
until
the
end
of
the
season
he
it
shows
how
well
the
clubs
are
going
to
get
other
clubs
like
that
should
they
decide
to
move
on
a
win
for
robertsons
side
against
ferencvaros
would
put
them
through
to
the
last
thisisanumber
if
basle
fail
to
beat
but
the
fact
that
weve
been
playing
european
football
for
the
last
three
or
four
years
is
obviously
an
incentive
added
to
play
for
the
football
club
who
are
committed
and
a
run
in
europe
always
helps
a
little
bit
with
the
game
being
played
at
murrayfield
instead
of
tynecastle
because
of
uefa
regulations
robertson
sees
both
positive
and
negative
aspects
to
the
change
of
greatest
at
the
weekend
and
the
pitch
is
a
bit
threadbare
he
same
for
both
teams
so
we
just
have
to
go
out
and
there
and
he
added
if
tynecastle
could
have
hosted
thisisanumber
it
would
have
been
fantastic
but
thats
one
of
the
benefits
of
murrayfield
it
allows
us
to
bring
even
more
of
our
supporters
into
and
the
hearts
fans
have
an
important
role
to
them
to
get
right
behind
the
side
and
make
it
as
good
an
atmosphere
as
that
and
i
know
they
will
because
its
a
fantastic
european
night
for
the
unlikely
matchwinner
to
earn
arsenal
a
hardfought
win
at
thisisanumber
shot
for
his
first
goal
in
thisisanumber
months
to
take
arsenal
back
into
second
spot
five
points
behind
two
chances
of
the
game
fell
to
pompey
striker
ricardo
wide
when
clear
and
his
control
let
him
down
in
the
second
half
when
well
the
ball
to
deny
arsenal
space

the

patrick

have
done

tight

he
missed
his

at

good

after
henry

set
him
from

out
quickly
to

there
were
some
anxious
seconds
for

as
the

ran
loose
before
matthew

have
taken
the
lead
on
thisisanumber
advantage
to
allow
steve

to
send

having
shrugged
off

the
pompey

planted
his
shot
wide
from

shot
through
a
ruck
of
players
and
inches
clear
but
failed
to
hit
the

its

i

he

criticised
by
a
number
of

on

it
showed
how
much
i
mean
to
about
transfer
rumours
its
between

havent
phoned
every
national

saying
blackburn

the

a
half

he
epitomises
like
that

there
are
not

stay

there

switch
to
stamford
bridge
has
again
arisen
with
the
january
transfer
window
future
when
he
said
he
wanted
the
club
to
prove
they
were
title
challengers
in
the
very
near
future
or
he
might
that
gerrard
has
promised
him
he
wants
to
stay
at
that
i
was
sure
he
wanted
to
stay
here
and
he
said
i
if
you
want
to
win
titles
you
want
medals
and
you
want
liverpool
to
have
these
things
then
i
am
going
to
need
your
stay
so
now
what
we
must
do
is
make
the
squad
stronger
for
him
meanwhile
gerrard
has
urged
the
anfield
board
to
sign
real
madrid
striker
fernando
morientes
in
the
january
transfer
willingness
to
come
to
in
cup
competitions
and
also
in
the
champions
to
play
for
us
in
europe
this
season
but
if
we
are
able
to
get
hold
of
him
wed
be
getting
ourselves
a
great
manager
and
we
have
got
three
or
four
spanish
players
here
now
so
theyll
help
him
settle
and
he
knows
how
to
strengthen
the
squad
hes
got
and
if
the
right
players
become
available
at
the
right
price
i
am
sure
we
will
see
a
few
new
faces
in
january
to
freshen
things
no
plans
to
become
a
manager
when
his
playing
career
is
a
coach
but
i
would
like
to
have
football
schools
the
england
captain
said
on
television
station
canal
since
i
went
to
the
bobby
charlton
london
and
one
in
i
am
an
ambassador
for
unicef
and
it
gives
me
great
pride
but
beckham
revealed
that
his
immediate
priority
was
winning
the
spanish
league
title
with
real
leaders
barcelona
with
a
thisisanumber
defeat
at
the
hands
of
sevilla
on
to
see
the
results
considering
the
team
we
la
liga
with
real
madrid
i
have
been
here
two
years
and
we
still
have
not
done
it
in
a
wideranging
interview
beckham
also
revealed
that
his
sendingoff
against
argentina
and
the
resulting
media
storm
had
been
the
most
significant
moment
in
his
said
to
be
sent
off
against
argentina
it
was
not
for
the
sendingoff
but
for
what
happened
a
manager
sir
alex
ferguson
who
supported
me
and
a
strong
family
behind
me
but
i
believe
that
changed
the
to
sign
juninho
if
the
brazilian
decides
to
leave
celtic
frustrated
at
his
lack
of
firstteam
juninho
does
not
wish
to
remain
in
scottish
football
thisisanumber
brazilian
midfielder
is
determined
to
win
back
his
going
to
pick
him
thats
a
different
ball
game
he
told
the
hassell
warns
that
juninho
could
reconsider
his
future
at
celtic
unless
he
is
given
a
run
of
games
by
the
end
of
the
january
transfer
the
summer
but
he
has
failed
to
live
up
to
high
expectations
and
has
lost
his
place
to
thisisanumber
aiden
and
hes
the
best
signing
celtic
ever
made
insisted
oneill
but
does
martin
oneill
want
to
play
him
juninho
is
not
someone
who
has
come
through
the
celtic
is
bullish
about
his
hopes
of
prising
juninho
from
the
scottish
champions
although
hassell
believes
mexico
would
not
be
his
preferred
and
he
said
if
he
has
no
firm
offer
from
a
club
in
spain
veracruz
will
be
his
destination
sanchez
told
his
clubs
official
of

his
way
into
the

that
is
certainly
the
case

valenciana
a

pleased
at
the

the
bulgarian

our

their

a
midfielder
whose
season
has
already
been
affected
by
a
rather
awkward
time
he
i
spoke
with
the
bulgarian
manager
hristo
stoichkov
and
he
mentioned
this
game
to
the
ones
that
if
an
awkward
fixture
is
going
to
be
played
at
some
stage
or
another
it
should
be
to
our
benefit
rather
than
anyone
bulgaria
are
the
one
nation
who
seem
to
organise
a
lot
of
friendly
battling
portsmouth
side
just
as
it
looked
like
the
premiership
leaders
would
have
to
settle
for
a
deflected
leftfooted
shot
from
the
right
side
of
pompeys
box
to
break
the
home
sides
brave
joe
cole
added
a
second
with
a
thisisanumber
shot
in
when
his
effort
was
tipped
good
voice
as
usual
and
even
though
portsmouth
more
than
held
their
own
chelsea
still
managed
to
carve
out
two
early
angled
shot
to
force
home
keeper
shaka
hislop
into
a
smart
save
while
an
unmarked
frank
lampard
had
a
strike
blocked
by
arjan
de
a
chelsea
side
as
the
southcoast
side
started
to
gain
the
upper
hand
and
almost
took
the
lead
through
range
shot
which
keeper
petr
cech
tipped
over
at
full
recently
and
were
providing
a
similarly
tough
obstacle
to
overcome
for
a
chelsea
team
struggling
to
exert
any
the
visitors
came
out
in
lively
fashion
after
the
break
but
just
as
they
took
a
stranglehold
of
the
match
the
visitors
launched
a
of
goal
and
struck
a
fierce
shot
which
rocked
keeper
hislop
back
as
he
blocked
before
arjan
de
zeeuw
cleared
the
breathing
a
sigh
of
relief
when
a
glen
johnson
header
fell
to
gudjohnsen
who
had
his
back
to
goal
in
a
crowded
pompey
direct
the
ball
into

put
his
effort
let
in
a
late

a

off
matthew

in

coming

the
pressure
on

rivals
arsenal
ahead
of
the

facing
newcastle
on
day
after
chelsea
beat
portsmouth
during
a
busy
festive
to
have
two
or
three
days
rest
in
which
to
the
television
john
terrychelsea
boss
jose
mourinho
admitted
his
side
were
lucky
to
win
at
fratton
park
but
is
still
unhappy
with
the
amount
of
games
in
such
a
short
space
of
time
during
this
time
of
play
two
matches
in
three
days
which
is
foreign
to
many
of
my
players
and
although
i
understand
the
traditions
of
football
here
at
this
time
of
year
it
is
not
good
for
your
health
to
do
cigars
one
after
another
and
it
is
a
good
life
but
it
is
not
actually
good
for
not
healthy
especially
for
teams
who
still
have
european
he
is
at
a
loss
to
explain
why
newcastle
are
languishing
in
the
bottom
half
of
the
park
on
wednesday
with
newcastle
thisisanumber
in
the
premiership
after
a
troubled
of
the
season
you
would
expect
them
to
be
fighting
for
the
top
to
be
where
they
outside
that
they
have
many
injuriesarsenal
go
into
the
game
on
the
back
of
a
thisisanumber
victory
over
fulham
on
to
prepare
for
a
game
is
to
win
the
previous
good
part
in
the
next
few
weeks
as
we
have
players
coming
back
so
i
can
rotate
a
bit
with
thisisanumber
players
and
i
believe
that
all
of
our
squad
deserve
a
chance
in
the
team
striker
thierry
henry
along
with
robert
pires
scored
against
as
beautiful
to
and
the
three
points
of
really
you
play
like
we
did
against
and
that
is
important
because
there
were
some
games
when
we
maybe
were
not
there
as
a
team
and
suffered
for
his
players
gutsy
performance
in
the
thisisanumber
win
at
aston
of
the
season
and
it
was
a
fantastic
game
of
football
endtoend
with
lots
of
good
passing
said
the
old
trafford
guts
and
we
werent
going
to
think
weve
been
there
and
won
while
arsenal
and
chelsea
have
yet
to
come
and
villa
may
have
some
players
back
when
they
do
ferguson
also
hailed
senior
stars
ryan
giggs
and
roy
keane
who
came
off
the
bench
for
the
injured
john
bit
of
composure
to
the
midfield
which
we
needed
and
which
no
other
player
has
he
brings
tremendous
our
form
play
as
we
are
and
well
get
our
team
were
robbed
at
manchester
united
after
pedro
mendes
shot
clearly
crossed
the
line
but
was
not
earpiece
so
why
cant
we
just
stop
the
game
and
get
the
decision
right
said
jol
after
the
thisisanumber
day
its
so
obvious
that
pedros
shot
was
over
the
line
its
for
the
linesman
and
referee
to
see
it
mendes
shot
from
thisisanumber
yards
and
united
goalkeeper
roy
carroll
spilled
the
ball
into
his
own
net
before
hooking
it
about
the
ball
being
a
couple
of
centimetres
or
an
inch
or
two
over
the
line
it
was
a
metre
inside
the
we
are
here
in
thisisanumber
watching
something
on
a
tv
monitor
within
two
seconds
of
the
incident
occurring
and
the
referee
isnt
told
about
i
am
pleased
even
now
with
a
point
although
we
should
have
had
three
mendes
could
not
believe
the
goal
was
not
given
after
seeing
a
pitch
was
to
it
was
clearly
over
the
line
ive
never
seen
one
so
over
the
line
and
not
given
in
my
about
it
its
a
nice
goal
and
one
to
keep
in
my
memory
even
though
it
didnt
from
the
halfway
line
manchester
united
manager
sir
alex
ferguson
sympathised
with
tottenham
and
said
the
incident
highlighted
the
need
for
video
a
lot
of
people
have
been
asking
for
and
thats
that
technology
should
play
a
part
in
the
game
ferguson
told
the
time
factor
in
video
other
day
which
suggested
that
if
a
referee
cant
make
up
his
mind
after
thisisanumber
seconds
of
watching
a
video
replay
then
the
game
should
carry
amount
of
time
it
takes
to
organise
a
freekick
or
take
a
corner
or
a
lot
of
by
using
it
for
goalline
opening
into
a
new
area
of
football
arsenal
boss
arsene
wenger
also
used
the
incident
to
highlight
the
need
for
video
the
referee
has
seen
there
should
be
a
goal
at
old
trafford
that
just
reinforces
what
i
feel
there
should
be
video
evidence
said
the
referee
could
have
asked
to
see
a
replay
and
would
have
seen
in
five
seconds
that
it
was
a
kicking
played
a
big
part
in
englands
thisisanumber
defeat
to
and
also
missed
a
relatively
easy
drop
goal
attempt
which
would
have
given
england
a
late
and
with
my
myself
hodgson
but
its
something
i
will
have
to
get
through
and
come
back
just
didnt
happen
hodgson
revealed
that
olly
barkley
had
taken
three
penalties
because
they
were
out
of
my
range
but
the
centre
could
not
convert
his
opportunities
either
particularly
the
drop
goal
late
hit
my
boot
it
had
recover
andy
robinson
said
he
would
keep
working
on
the
kicking
with
his
he
would
take
some
positives
from
the
played
some
very
good
rugby
and
what
have
france
done
he
penalties
from
our
thisisanumber
ambition
in
the
first
half
they
went
out
to
sustain
it
in
the
second
but
couldnt
build
on
and
you
know
when
you
do
that
it
is
a
lottery
whether
the
referee
is
going
to
give
the
penalty
to
your
side
or
the
other
should
have
winning
and
losing
and
for
the
second
week
weve
been
on
the
wrong
side
of
that
line
and
it
hurtsengland
went
in
at
halftime
with
a
thisisanumber
lead

they
failed
to
score
in

may
now
be
called
into

yet
clear
but
bath
boss
john
connolly
rates
him
no
better
than
thisisanumber
to
face
englands
defeat
by
france
and
if
he
is
unable
to
play
englands
constantlychanging
midfield
will
once
again
have
to
be

henry

tait

on
saturday
and
paul
limped
off
with
an
ankle
injury
against
the

under

for
what

have
been

perfectly
legal

there
is
no

about

he
has
called
it
his

and
we
have
got
to
be
able
to
cope
with
done
to
win
the

and
with
a
couple
of
decisions
this
could
have
been
a

famous
at

the
likes
of

martin

moody
all
came
through

of

stood
up
out
credit
must
go
to
all
the
a
game
of

but
ireland
are
a
good
every
chance
of
winning
this
six
nations
england
have
lost
their
first
three
matches
in
this
years
six
nations
and
four
out
of
their
six
games
since
robinson
took
over
from
sir
clive
woodward
in
sides
thisisanumber
victory
over
england
as
a
special
total
of
thisisanumber
points
including
two
drop
goals
to
help
keep
alive
their
grand
slam
hard
work
of
it
but
its
still
special
to
beat
the
game
but
this
but
we
never
take
a
victory
over
england
lightly
ireland
hooker
shane
byrne
echoed
ogaras
comments
but
admitted
the
game
had
been
englands
best
outing
in
the
six
really
hard
game
but
from
one
to
thisisanumber
in
our
team
we
worked
really
really
our
defensive
pattern
trust
ourselves
and
trust
those
around
captain
brian
odriscoll
who
scored
his
sides
only
try
said
we
are
delighted
we
felt
if
we
performed
well
then
we
would
win
but
with
england
also
having
played
very
well
it
makes
it
all
the
the
ball
and
some
days
that
happens
and
youve
just
got
to
jump
on
the
back
of
itireland
coach
eddie
osullivan
was
surprised
that
england
coach
andy
robinson
said
he
was
certain
mark
cueto
was
onside
for
a
disallowed
try
just
before
the
me
and
i
couldnt
see
whether
he
was
offside
or
not
so
i
dont
know
how
andy
could
have
known
said
england
played
well
and
when
that
happens
it
makes
a
very
good
victory
for
periods
and
that
is
all
good
for
the
confidence
of
the
well
worked
it
was
a
gem
as
good
a
try
as
we
have
scored
for
a
while
osullivan
also
rejected
robinsons
contention
england
dominated
the
forward
and
they
lost
four
or
five
so
i
dont
know
how
that
adds
up
to
domination
he
to
handle
the
pressure
of
being
considered
favourites
to
win
the
six
nations
we
have
been
able
to
play
with
the
favourites
tag
he
and
can
continue
to
keep
doing
a
move
we
had
worked
on
all
from
geordan
murphy
and
it
was
a
great
break
from
denis
ruled
out
of
the
rest
of
the
six

with
a
broken
monday
after
fracturing
his

he
admitted

angry
with
the

he
was

off

it
was

just
before

with
either
tait
or
noon
dropping
in

received
praise
from

afterwards
even
if
the

admitted
cardiff
was
an
unforgiving
place
for
the
teenage
over
whether
to
withdraw
from
the
firing
line
after
just
one
outing
a
player
he
regards
as
central
to
englands
unaffected
by
the
punishing
treatment
dished
out
to
him
by
gavin
henson
in
he
week
and
get
selected
for
next
week
but
well
have
to
look
at
the
video
and
wait
and
thisisanumber
for
a
lot
of
the
first
half
so
it
was
quite
but
weve
just
got
to
pick
it
up
for

hardly
covered
himself

england
clearly

than

minutes
said
three
firsthalf
possessions
in
their
half
and
we
scored

time
in
their
half
scrumhalf
peter
stringer
was
also
glad
that
ireland
escaped
wtih
a
bbc
coming
to
game
here
and
they
showed
a
lot
of
in
the
first
half
but
we
got
a
few
scores
when
we
got
into
their

ireland
to
a
workmanlike
victory
against
from
the

up

half

try
gave
ireland
a
lead

try
ensured
an
irish
blocks
and
took
the
lead
through
a
luciano

penalty
after
seven
the
hosts
but
the
flyhalf
missed
two
kickable
penalties
and
ireland
drew
level
with
a
ronan
ogara
penalty
midway
through
the
first
heart
of
the
irish
defence
and
for
the
first
quarter
the
irish
pack
struggled
to
secure
any
ball
for
their
talented
the
halfhour
mark
odriscoll
promptly
created
a
sparkling
try
for
scissors
and
made
a
magical
outside
break
before
drawing
the
fullback
and
putting
the
diving
murphy
in
at
the
the
visitors
found
themselves
trailing
once
kicking
duties
for
italy
from
the
hapless
orquera
and
he
landed
a
penalty
either
side
of
the
break
to
edge
italy
into
a
thisisanumber
real
threat
was
odriscoll
and
it
was
his
break
that
set
up
the
second
try
for
the
as
he
was
about
to
be
forced
into
touch
and
stringer
scooted
over
with
ogara
landing
the
tricky
thisisanumber
as
the
game
entered
the
final
quarter
but
they
were
lucky
to
survive
when
italy
launched
a
series
of
he
reached
for
the
line
and
italy
nearly
rumbled
over
from
a
driving
than
a
converted
try
ahead
and
they
made
the
game
safe
when
hickie
latched
onto
an
inside
pass
from
murphy
and
crossed
for
a
converted
centre
partner
gordon
darcy
on
the
sidelines
and
the
final
word
went
to
a
try
which
was
fitting
reward
for
an
italian
pack
which
had
kept

there

under

on
the

before
charlie

put

was

jones
wales
captain
this
is
touch
and

it
was
out

obviously

phenomenal

the
way
he

was
happy
to
hail

heroic
contribution
to
wales
first
win

in

since
balanced

he
glides

obviously
hes
got
a
great
kicking

as
well
jones
some
great
hits
and
he
had
a
great
england
for
the
first
time

no

fuel
expectations
of

might
achieve

consistency
to
get
further
and
we
cant
afford
to
get
too
giddy
about
this
and
keep
focused
on
facing
italynone
more
so
than
henson
who
can
now
expect
to
have
the
same
sort
of
spotlight
thrust
upon
him
as
the
likes
of
jonny
wilkinson
and
brian
the
prospect
of
dealing
with
such
weighty
expectations
likes

on
me
he
i
think
i
perform
better
under
more
england
and
ive
got
to
back
it
up
next
italy
i
wasnt
involved
and
we
lost
so
weve
got
to
put
that
right
next

miss

because

in

very
good

as

came
recklessly
over

grewcock
did
a
similar
thing
for

last

grewcock
was
banned
from

for
two
months
for

grewcock
became
only

in
jason
robinson
have
both
said
that
the
clash
with
peel
was
back
of
the
ruck
and
i
feel
i
can
step
over
and
disrupt
it
then
i
will
do
that
said
man
should
be
more
his
actions
it
was
a
clumsy
piece
of
footwork
he
dont
want
to
knock
him
we
wont
be
calling
for
the
match
commissioner
to
review
the
far
with
the
action
and
dwayne
had
just
a
minor
was
attempting
to
step
over
the
ruck
ruddock
also
warned
his
rbs
thisisanumber
nations
championship
rivals
that
his
team
can
make
massive
squandered
them
by
taking
more
contact
and
playing
more
individually
said
the
video
debrief
and
there
were
definitely
a
lot
of
chances
that
we
wasted
in
the
forthcoming
games
ruddock
may
use
penalty
hero
gavin
henson
as
his
firstchoice
kicker
in
place
of
stephen
gavin
settled
into
the
team
but
its
something
well
talk
about
in
selection
this
week
said
glittering
prize
in
itself
but
every
player
from
the
four
home
unions
will
also
have
one
eye
on
a
possible
trip
to
new
zealand
with
the
lions
this
claim
for
a
place
in
the
starting
xv
over
the
weekend
was
gavin
his
interview
afterwards
he
beamed
with
confidence
but
although
theres
an
element
of
arrogance
its
good
of
heels
to
mathew
tait
when
he
got
outside
him
his
defence
was
very
good
and
he
made
some
great
kicks
out
of
majestic
matchwinning
wait
and
see
what
happens
because
he
needs
to
be
put
to
the
brian
odriscoll
or
a
big
french
player
who
impressed
very
confident
and
he
was
a
nice
general
for
his
the
moment
due
to
inury
the
number
thisisanumber
shirt
could
be
up
for
grabs
and
jones
or
maybe
even
henson
could
make
the
lions
team
at
he
certainly
looks
a
better
bet
than
charlie
hodgson
after
saturdays
me
because
i
thought
they
would
be
outmuscled
in
the
tight
capable
player
but
when
it
comes
down
to
selection
gethin
jenkins
is
now
going
to
have
the
upper
hand
because
he
came
out
on
phil
vickery
will
be
in
the
no
solid
game
and
jason
robinson
and
josh
lewsey
both
did
nothing
young
mathew
tait
and
i
think
it
will
be
a
while
before
we
see
him
scots
caught
my
eye
against
done
it
before
but
the
likes
of
chris
cusiter
jason
white
and
ally
hogg
all
made
their
runs
while
white
had
a
pretty
robust
game
his
defence
is
right
up
could
be
a
very
good
option
for
lions
coach
sir
clive
italy
in
rome
looks
like
a
certainty
to
make
the
starting
xv
against
new
italy
made
the
breaks
and
fed
his
outside
backs
although
italy
defended
man
on
man
which
made
it
easy
for
off
injured
early
on
but
i
think
you
could
get
a
henson
darcy
odriscoll
combination
in
the
lions
a
hard
edge
to
his
game
and
malcolm
okelly
keeps
on
going
and
seems
to
be
putting
his
hand
up
while
shane
byrne
seems
to
be
a
lively
worried
after
the
italian
pack
drove
them
off
their
own
ball
on
sunday
although
i
used
to
play
in
italy
and
i
know
how
difficult
it
can
was
wales
scrumhalf
dwayne
second
half
when
wales
were
kicked
the
ball
away
i
wouldnt
want
him
as
my
lions
scrumhalf
after
play
to
the
italians
they
made
us
work
very
hard
for
our
and
they
proved
again
that
they
are
getting
better
and
better
as
the
years
go
italian
team
that
we
have
would
be
a
huge
threat
particularly
the
first
game
in
the
gone
by
when
you
could
get
scores
on
the
board
off
and
try
and
build
our
scores
there
and
the
players
have
plenty
of
bumps
and
bruises
to
prove
are
one
or
two
others
who
will
be
feeling
it
a
bit
on
monday
frustrated
at
such
but
the
new
rucking
laws
were
a
little
bit
and
the
players
was
a
little
ball
in
our
hands
and
i
got
a
try
near
the
end
of
the
first
and
i
always
knew
i
had
scored
even
though
it
went
upstairs
to
the
video
halftime
even
though
we
were
only
thisisanumber
to
do
and
advocated
getting
the
ball
out
of
our
own
a
bit
more
difficult
to
get
out
of
our
own
the
breakdown
and
if
they
had
kicked
all
their
chances
at
goal
we
would
have
been
behind
at
the
playing
a
territory
game
and
simplifying
things
and
having
more
patience
on
the
after
the
game
following
the
injuries
to
brian
and
the
full
extent
of
the
injuries
but
it
does
not
that
scotland
and
only
six
days
to
a
bruising
the
scots
played
against
the
french
on
their
way
but
for
a
couple
of
it
is
going
to
be
tough
for
two
changes
from
the
team
that
beat
italy
thisisanumber
for
saturdays

sustained
during
the
six
nations
game
against
italy
last
was
already
pushing
hard
for
a
start
at
stade
de
the
bench
kevin
was
very
much
in
the
selection
mix
anyway
and
the
unfortunate
injury
to
hal
gives
him
the
chance
to
start
said
from
injury
we
have
increased
the
options
in
the
back
his
spot
after
performing
well
against
italy
and
scoring
a
try
but
such
is
the
competition
for
places
that
every
position
is
debated
in
we
might
not
always
be
afforded
the
open
spaces
out
wide
we
were
able
to
exploit
against
italy
so
an
extra
big
ballcarrier
in
the
backrow
is
thought
to
be
necessary
on
this
days
and
there
is
every
chance
that
jonathan
will
be
making
an
impact
from
the
bench
wales
have
beaten
france
on
two
of
their
last
three
visits
to
paris
and
another
victory
this
time
around
would
keep
them
firmly
on
course
for
a
first
five
or
six
nations
title
triumph
since
a
couple
of
years
ago
that
we
should
be
bold
when
going
to
france
and
he
was
proved
right

for

of

is
what
every
player
things
have
gone
but
we
have
to
get
it
right
this
weekend
white
is
now
one
of

more
experienced

of

white
is
now
in

position
to
offer
his
experience
to
youngsters
such
as
centres
matthew
tait
and
jamie
a
tighthead
can
give
a
centre
but
you
are
there
to
give
them
a
pat
on
the
back
if
things
go
wrong
or
to
be
there
if
they
want
to
talk
in
any
way
he
squad
people
like
jason
leonard
and
martin
johnson
were
the
first
to
come
over
and
talk
through
things
and
help
confidence
when
people
like
that
speak
to
lot
of
them
so
to
sit
down
and
speak
with
them
and
realise
you
are
on
the
same
wavelength
is
good
white
missed
the
vast
majority
of
last
years
six
nations
because
of
a
knee
injury
and
is
raring
for
the
thisisanumber
event
to
get
game
taking
place
amid
the
redhot
atmosphere
in
of
the
best
stadiums
in
the
world
he
the
shouting
and
the
singing
its
one
of
my
favourite
places
to
six
nations
for
a
long
all
but
you
just
dont
know
thats
the
great
thing
about
this
odriscoll
guided
ireland
to
a
workmanlike
victory
against
from
the
ireland
captain
set
up
tries
for
geordan
murphy
and
peter
second
half
but
stringers
try
gave
ireland
a
lead
they
never
thisisanumber
with
thisisanumber
minutes
left
and
nearly
scored
through
ludovico
nitoglia
but
denis
hickies
try
ensured
an
irish
blocks
and
took
the
lead
through
a
luciano
orquera
penalty
after
seven
the
hosts
but
the
flyhalf
missed
two
kickable
penalties
and
ireland
drew
level
with
a
ronan
ogara
penalty
midway
through
the
first
heart
of
the
irish
defence
and
for
the
first
quarter
the
irish
pack
struggled
to
secure
any
ball
for
their
talented
the
halfhour
mark
odriscoll
promptly
created
a
sparkling
try
for
scissors
and
made
a
magical
outside
break
before
drawing
the
fullback
and
putting
the
diving
murphy
in
at
the
the
visitors
found
themselves
trailing
once
kicking
duties
for
italy
from
the
hapless
orquera
and
he
landed
a
penalty
either
side
of
the
break
to
edge
italy
into
a
thisisanumber
real
threat
was
odriscoll
and
it
was
his
break
that
set
up
the
second
try
for
the
as
he
was
about
to
be
forced
into
touch
and
stringer
scooted
over
with
ogara
landing
the
tricky
thisisanumber
as
the
game
entered
the
final
quarter
but
they
were
lucky
to
survive
when
italy
launched
a
series
of
he
reached
for
the
line
and
italy
nearly
rumbled
over
from
a
driving
than
a
converted
try
ahead
and
they
made
the
game
safe
when
hickie
latched
onto
an
inside
pass
from
murphy
and
crossed
for
a
converted
centre
partner
gordon
darcy
on
the
sidelines
and
the
final
word
went
to
a
try
which
was
fitting
reward
for
an
italian
pack
which
had
kept
the
irish
under

we
will
get

because
of

im

he

of

bernard

recall
frederic

to
give
his

any
chance

yann
delaigue

six

to
is
the
answer
both
now
and
for
the
time
has
come
to
bring
back
the
allround
game
to
upset
ireland
the
thisisanumber
michalak
has
spent
much
of
the
tournament
on
the
bench
after
delaigue
impressed
for
castres
early
in
the
to
narrow
wins
over
scotland
and
then
england
before
ironically
playing
their
best
rugby
in
the
defeat
to
watch
but
never
did
i
think
the
french
could
lose
that
game
at
halftime
said
didnt
score
enough
points
in
the
first
half
and
were
a
little
bit
less
focused
in
the
however
insisted
the
pressure
had
eased
on
the
underfire
laporte
despite
the
defeat
at
the
stade
de
shaping
a
team
for
the
thisisanumber
world
cup
said
sella
which
laporte
is
doing
very
a
team
and
you
change
your
tactics
as
everything
has
to
the
talent
to
take
them
all
the
way
to
world
cup
that
people
give
him
that
were
not
winning
the
grand
slam
but
no
one
will
care
in
two
years
time
if
were
world
championsthe
majority
of
media
criticism
centred
on
the
way
in
which
france
produced
a
performance
devoid
of
running
rugby
in
their
opening
two
the
more
flowing
style
employed
against
wales
he
said
the
win
was
most
been
so
good
but
the
discipline
organisation
and
defence
was
there
which
are
all
important
ahead

what
sella
believes
is
their
hardest

game

been
billed
as
a

could

up
being
a

battle
of
the

both
teams
are
desperate
to
gain
their
first
win
said
the
lock
since
they
joined
the
six
nations
in

but
two
of
those
have
come
against
a
stubborn
display
against
ireland
but
ended
up
losing
an
impressive
welsh
side
in
rome
last
time
hoping
to
claim
their
first
away
win
in
the
six
in
paris
but
not
so
well
when
ireland
came
to
edinburgh
said
our
last
game
against
wales
in
rome
and
we
are
thoroughly
determined
to
right
the
to
be
respected
as
a
team
worthy
of
a
place
in
this
tournament
and
we
can
only
do
this
by
winning
robinson

the
right
man
to

what

in

for
we
put
in

on

then
we
can
start
turning
results
taking

with
england
and
we
are
at
the

you
need
to
experience
the
bad
the
before
you
can
fully
appreciate
the
gooda
trip
to
lansdowne

is
daunting
at
any
time
especially
against
an

side
that
are
flying
high
after
two
impressive

tournament
and
are
tipped
to
claim
their

playing

they
have
explosive
runners
out
on
paper
they
have
stars
from
one
to

a
great
opportunity
for
to
play
in
and
we
have
to
use
it
to
our
are
determined
to
set
the
perfect

by
dominating
the

the

is

where
they
left
off

win

so
he
is
up
for

warned
uncharacteristic
onedimensional

needs
to
show
more

the

not
big
enough
to
trouble
his

nothing

said
jones
who
will
be
facing

for

hopefully
get

it

had
been
axed
after
a

display
last

the
least
i
can
say
is
that
he
didnt
make
a
thundering
comeback
against
wales
said
be
fast
and
rough
and
we
also
want
to
be
able
to
replace
both
locks
during
the
game
if
needed
and
gregory
lamboley
can
also
come
on
at

seven
or
well
go

to

because
ireland
have
three
wins
under
their

have
just
defeated
england
and
have
their
eyes
set
on
a

slam
france
who
lost

last
week
must
defeat
the
irish
to
keep
alive
their
hopes
of
retaining
the
six

tournament
and
have
their

set

which
followed

neck
and

since

have
lost

of

against

in

but
it
is
touch
and
go
said
and
the
key
now
is
how
he
is
reintroduced
to
playing
and
with
it
off
the
bench
to
start
and
it
would
be
ridiculous
and
irresponsible
to
put
him
straight
back
into

wrong
with
a
knee
and
they
are
relaxed
about
it

a
lock
the
bbc
fullbacks
are
too
far
away
from
the
personally
he
added
i
just
think
the
point
of
influence
needs
to
move
closer
to
the
pack
which
is
after
all
where
games
usually
start
and
finish
moore
says
a
lack
of
cohesion
in
the
forwards
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
england
have
lost
against
wales
france
and
ireland
in
this
years
were
not
getting
enough
people
into
the
breakdowns
he
means
the
backs
are
being
and
were
not
getting
thatwith
injuries
depriving
him
of
key
players
like
wilkinson
coach
andy
robinson
has
given
youngsters
such
as
harry
ellis
and
jamie
noon
a
games
against
italy
and
scotland
are
a
good
opportunity
to
experiment
are
around
to
replace
the
icons
which
have
been
lost
because
of
retirement
and
injury
dont
have
the
requisite
experience
moore
but
play
knocking
on
the
door
its
time
for
them
to
be
looked
at
in
these
last
two
games
because
theres
nothing
on
with
a
greater
certainty
of
who
can
and
cannot
handle
the
pressure
of
international
replacing
gareth
thomas
as
wales
captain
will
be
straightforward
because
of
the
leadership
quality
in
the
but
it
never
enters
your
head
that
you
will
one
day
captain
your
country
he
there
are
so
many
experienced
players
in
the
side
but
it
will
be
a
massive
honour
coach
mike
ruddock
says
the
thisisanumber
should
take
the
armband
from
broken
thumb
victim
thomas
against
and
pack
leader
in
this
years
wins
over
england
italy
and
france
notably
his
role
in
the
secondhalf
in
paris
following
thomas
thomas
will
be
badly
missed
massive
loss
because
he
is
a
brilliant
player
and
he
has
done
a
fantastic
job
since
he
has
been
captain
said
stamp
on
but
the
strength
of
the
squad
is
shown
when
you
have
someone
like
kevin
morgan
to
step
inowen
admitted
the
grand
slam
had
been
mentioned
within
the
squad
but
that
noone
was
getting
carried
away
with
the
three
victories
over
england
italy
and
he
up
and
we
are
just
looking
forward
to
preparing
for
france
and
were
unlucky
not
to
get
a
in
the
first
thisisanumber
minutes
before
falling
similar
journey
to
the
one
we
have
been
on
in
the
last
couple
of
side
can
upset
england
as
the
six
nations
wooden
spoon
battle
hots
win
meet
on
thisisanumber
march
at
twickenham
and
kirwan
says
his
side
will
be
hoping
to
make
the
most
of
englands
current
england
and
france
games
are
tough
for
best
of
us
and
them
and
i
am
sure
my
players
will
rise
to
the
occasion
he
of
hard
work
will
be
needed
with
his
kickers
before
the
trip
to
had
a
miserable
time
with
the
boot
in
the
dire
defeat
to
scotland
as
chris
paterson
stole
the
show
to
give
the
hosts
a
muchneeded
thisisanumber
decisive
factor
in
scotland
which
cost
us
and
it
could
go
down
to
the
kicking
again
next
confidence
in
my
players
and
i
am
positive
we
can
put
everything
together
against
england
england
meanwhile
are
licking
their
wounds
and
rueing
what
might
have
been
had
two
decisions
from
referee
jonathan
kaplan
not
gone
against
them
in
the
second
half
in
as
he
chased
flyhalf
charlie
hodgsons
kick
and
then
kaplan
opted
not
to
call
upon
video
evidence
to
see
if
josh
lewsey
had
touched
down
after
being
driven
over
irelands
side
at
least
showed
better
form
than
their
previous
two
irish
side
he
that
we
would
be
able
to
compete
and
i
think
we
showed
we
now
take
the
form
and
positives
into
the
italy
it
is
going
to
be
easy
but
we
definitely
need
a
win
england
have
now
equalled
an
thisisanumber
low
of
four
successive
championship
defeats
including
france
in
paris
last
season
and
have
lost
four

coach
eddie
osullivan
has
not

to
contend
with
the
sort
of
casualty
lists
that
have
hit
england
and
scotland
in
particular
prior
to
the
need
to
stay
relatively
injury
free
and
fortunately
we
are
one
of
the
few
teams
that
have
done
that
so
far
wood
and
we
need
to
take
all
the
luck
and
opportunities
that
come
our
way
irelands
last
game
of
the
tournament
is
against
wales
in
cardiff
a
fixture
they
have
not
lost
since
the
irish
are
visiting
wood
believes
wales
might
end
their
fourmatch
losing
run
against
england
in
players
have
either
retired
in
the
last
year
or
are
injured
that
i
think
it
will
be
very
hard
for
them
down
in
cardiff
wood
in
the
last
year
or
so
and
lost
all
four
so
the
time
is
right
for
them
now
to
beat
one
of
the
major
ahead
of
the
rbs
six

with
news
that
scott
gray
will
miss

we

you
in

get

get
out
on

and
thats
when
the
hard
work
rugby
has
to
act
now
to
prevent
injury
destroying
players
of
big
names
for
the
six
nations
as
the
intensity
of
professional
rugby

hits
but
we
have
to
have
a
look
at
the
amount
of
injuries
that
occur
in
the
english
season
robinson
told
bbc
to
have
three

four

its
findings

thats
got
some
great
information
in
there
that
i
think
everybody
in
the
english
game
has
got
to
look
at
he
going
to
get
worse
and
not
better
so
i
think
rugby

has
got
to
look
at

ended
his

a

has
battled
injury
for
the
last
two
of
his

that
would
have
kept

more

coming
that

in
the
around

currently

all
departed
in

that
im
committed
totally
to
scottish
weve
immersed
ourselves
in
scottish
away
however
he
attempted
to
steer
clear
of
taking
sides
in
the
national
team
is
separate
to
the
political
situation
he
like
this
and
you
are
trying
to
make
a
difference
then
there
are
always
people
who
will
begrudge
you
who
are
jealous
and
want
to
try
to
drag
you
have
to
have
the
courage
of
your
convictions
to
see
it
uninformed
comment
that
the
national
team
had
received
a
massive
increase
in
budget
at
the
expense
of
other
parts
of
scottish
rugby
and
that
is
simply
not
the
and
ask
for
an
uncertain
terms
that
the
financial
situation
did
not
allow
cigars
with
thisisanumber
notes
while
the
rest
of
scottish
rugby
flounders
is
absolutely
the
number
of
days
players
spent
with

to
compete
with
in
a
few

thisisanumber
days
together

have
another

before
the

that
is
what
we
are

to
run
out
on
the

for
former
england

testimonial
on

in

i
was
very
limited

a
few
months

the
giant
be
my
first
thisisanumber
game
but
i
have
a
training
schedule
which
is
quite
testing
and
combines
with
sevens
and
a
whole
lot
of
things
said
since
my
operation
that
i
train
three
times
a
day
six
days
a
you
are
dreaming
but
it
always
starts
off
with
a
want
to
make
it
a
reality
opinion
has
been
divided
on
whether
lomu
should
attempt
to
return
to
the
game
after
such
a
major
he
was
taking
a
risk
he
replied
as
much
as
someone
going
down
the
road
being
hit
by
a
in
the
world
with
one
kidney
who
just
dont
know
a
chat
with
the
donor
and
this
is
to
set
my
soul
at
peace
and
finish
something
i
started
in
thisisanumber
when
he
made
his
all
blacks
debut
at
his
lowest
ebb
lomu
was
so
ill
he
could
barely
walk
but
he
says
he
is
now
getting
stronger
every
day
and
his
longterm
target
is
to
play
for
new
zealand
at
my
worst
was
my
wife
he
and
fall
over
but
now
i
can
run
and
it
is
all
coming
back
and
a
lot
more
quickly
than
i
ever
thought
it
would
be
the
highest
honour
i
could
you
have
to
start
announced
he
is
to
retire
from
rugby
union
at
the
end
of
the
cup
glory
in
thisisanumber
will
play
his
final
match
in
quit
test
rugby

the
start
of

two
months
after
leading
sir
clive

team
to
victory
in

be
his
testimonial
at
twickenham
on
thisisanumber
right
decision
to
retire
said
next
season
when
ill
wish
i
was
out
there
playing
for
the
tigers
but
you
know
when
the
time
is
right
to
go
and
i
feel
this
is
the
right
play
for
another
season
but
playing
week
in
and
week
out
in
the
premiership
is
a
fulltime
occupation
and
i
only
want
to
be
out
there
for
the
right
reasons

lost

drew

at

but
the
teams
were
locked
at
thisisanumber
when
a
clem
thomas

kick
was
gathered
by

for
a
famous
matchwinning
wins
over
the
other

before

over

in
an

and
by

time
they
returned
in

they
were
undoubtedly
the
leading
side
in

when
a
drop

by

john

their
first
win
at

arms

in
four
attempts
and
went
unbeaten
through
the
rest
of
the
tour
but
when
they
returned
home
the
first
question
put
to
them
was
what
happened
in
newport
the
only
blemish
on
the
record
of
the
awesome
thisisanumber
tourists
was
a
draw
with
east
wales
as
they
beat
the
full
wales
team
thisisanumber
in
cardiff
to
take
the
lead
in
the
series
between

countries
for
the
first
comfortable

the

time
wales
had
toured
the
country
as
an
independent

in

was
edged

by
the

measure
of
revenge
for
the
defeat
inflicted
on

by
the
carwyn

lions
of
thisisanumber
win
over
the
tourists
at
stradey
park
though
and
in
the
final
game
of
the
tour
the
barbarians
defeated
the
all
blacks
thisisanumber
in
cardiff
in
a
game
regarded
by
many
as
the
greatest
ever
thisisanumber
at
the
arms
park
in
a
noncap
game
in
thisisanumber
but
it
was
the
thisisanumber
game
in
cardiff
that
would
reignite
the
history
of

between

thisisanumber
centenary
game
was
a
sign
of
things
to
hemisphere
game
that
had
left
europe
behind
was
shown
as
the
all

swatted
wales
aside
thisisanumber
in
brisbane
in
the
semifinal
of
the
inaugural
world
the

and
would
inflict
further
misery
on
wales
on
their
illfated
thisisanumber
tour
of
new
britain
full
of
confidence
as
triple
crown
winners
but
one
of
the
greatest
ever
new

teams
demolished
them
thisisanumber
and
in
the
provincial
games
wales
captain
jonathan
davies
returned
home
calling
for
urgent
change
in
the
national
game
but
as
his
views
were
ignored
he
along
with
a
generation
of
wales
best
players
chose
to
head
north
to
rugby
for
new
zealand
in
thisisanumber
and
at
the
thisisanumber
world
cup
wales
big
talk
was
made
to
look
embarrassing
as
the
all
blacks
eased
to
victory
in
wembley
followed
in
thisisanumber
and
as
wales
misery
increased
they
turned
to
new
zealand
for
their
salvation
in
the
shape
of
coaches
graham
henry
and
steve
the
welsh
game
but
when
an
experimental
new
zealand
side
came
to
cardiffs
new
millennium
stadium
in
thisisanumber
they
left
with
a
thisisanumber
wales
in
hamilton
in
thisisanumber
as
hansen
built
towards
the
world
cup
but
in
australia
it
was
a
remarkable
performance
against
the
all
blacks
that
gave
his
side
renewed
into
the
game
but
in
the
course
of
the
match
they
rediscovered
the
value
of
attacking
flair
to
lead
thisisanumber
early
in
the
second
win
but
the
style
shown
by
wales
has
been
used
as
an
inspiration
as
they
look
to
a
better
team
led
by
henry
and
hansen
coming
to
europe
with
a
weakened
squad
at
the
end
of
a
long
has
inspired
a
confident
wales
camp
to
believe
they
can
claim
their
first
win
over
the

a
twomonth
period
of

end
problems
of

availability

spectator
interest
would
respond
to
the
impetus
of
high
intensity
rugby
being
played
continuously
rather
than
the
fragmented
timetable
currently
in
would
prefer
the
sustained
interest
in
a
continuous
tournament
and
hopefully
the
broadcasters
would
also
enjoy
increased
exposure
moving
the
six
nations
from
its
traditional
february
beginning
should
also
ensure
better
weather
conditions
and
stimulate
greater
interest
in
the
games
and
generally
provide
increased
skills
and
competition
and
attract

board
next

where
four
other
plans
drawn
up
by
independent
consultants
for
a
global
integrated
season
will
also
be
and
there
are
a
number
of
caveats
associated
with
it
not
least
the
revenue
from
the
broadcasters
which
is
extremely
one
which
should
be
judged
on
its
as
englands
new

captain
for

from
lawrence
dallaglio
who
retired
from

he
is
a
natural
leader
holds
the
respect
of
the
squad
and
is
a
formidable
talent
on
the
and
commitment
i
feel
is
essential
to
be
captain
of
england
robinson
added
there
are
several
players
in
the
squad
i
would
feel
comfortable
in
calling
upon
to
be
england
captain
but
for
me
jonny
is
in
every
way
the
right
player
to
take
on
this
any
player
especially
following
in
the
footsteps
of
lawrence
dallaglio
and
before
him
the
world
cup
captain
martin
what
it
takes
to
do
an
outstanding
job
as
we
look
ahead
towards
the
next
rugby
world
cup
in

and
i
look
forward
to
working
with
him

scored

in

today
i
have

be

to
follow

a

to
me
as
they
are
inspirational
men
who
have
given
so
much
to
england
rugby
over
many
ireland
six
years
ago
was
something
ill
never
forget
because
to
play
for
your
country
is
very
important
step
in
my
career
and
i
do
so
with
immense
pride
wilkinson
made
his

four

his

has
polarised
do
no

of
success
for
england
dallaglios
crowning
glory
was
his
part
in
the
side
that
won
the
rugby
world
cup
in
take
an
alternative
view
seeing
dallaglio
as
the
epitome
of
the
less
agreeable
characteristics
of
english
be
it
to
the
referee
or
the
opposition
on
the
pitch
or
his
coach
or
the
media
off
it
dallaglio
has
sometimes
rubbed
people
up
the
wrong
unheralded
england
side
which
became
the
shock
winners
of
the
first
rugby
sevens
world
cup
in
to
graduate
to
the
full
england
xv
but
once
there
he
proved
to
the
manor
his
years
dallaglio
rapidly
established
himself
as
an
automatic
choice
able
to
play
any
one
of
the
three
backrow
positions
at
international
dallaglio
was
offered
the
england
captains

and
his
career
continued
to
go
from
strength
to

he
made

tour

south

of
england
teammate

played
a
massive
role
in
the

unstoppable
momentum
dallaglios
career
hit
the
buffers
at
speed
in
wales
in
which
dallaglios
decision
not
to
kick
for
goal
in
the
dying
minutes
was
blamed
for
costing
england
a
grand
an
infamous
newspaper
sting
cost
him
his
treasured
england
of
which
he
was
subsequently
cleared

a
devastated
dallaglio
stepped
down
as

level

fold
albeit
now
as

lieutenant

side
on
the
long
road
to

glory
a
journey
not
without
mishaps
as
a
succession
of
grand
slams

were
spurned

as
a
key
performer
once
as
a
serious
knee
injury
cut
short
dallaglios
involvement
on
the
lions
tour
to
career
was
over
but
in
typical
dallaglio
style
he
embarked
on
a
punishing
schedule
of
rehabilitation
to
return
an
even
more
fearsome
physical
to
rob
dallaglio
of
much
of
his
pace
but
ever
the
pragmatist
he
reinvented
himself
as
a
close
quarters
number
eight
of
the
highest
minute
of

dallaglio
could
hardly
have
done
more

secure

historic
win
and
for
that
he
will
always
be
held
in
the
highest
esteem
by
england

restored
him
as

losing
five
of
their
eight
postworld
cup
tests
dallaglio
led
by

leaving
him
as
one
of
the
few
members
of
a
squad
lacking
many
world
cup
stars
to
live
up
to
game
safe
in
the
knowledge
that
he
will
go
down
as
one
of
englands
most
accomplished
players
if
not
one
of
the
great
captains

his
evident
pride

we
are

have
achieved
that

it

a
quality
performance
against
a
very

side

came
through

was
a

of
thanking

who
had

there
have
been

they

made
it
for

i

anyone
what
i
have
to

told

in

was
forced
home
early
with
a
knee
injury
from
the

three

could
have
prolonged
his
international
shape
and
fresh
without
another
thisisanumber
tests
on
the
quarters
on
sunday
in
our
heineken
cup
match
against
leicester
i
certainly
didnt
feel
out
of
place
alongside
those
players
many
of
whom
will
be
on
the
then
im
most
certainly
need
to
look
outside
the
international
crop
then
need
to
look
too
far
will
offer
matt
dawson
a
new
has
impressed
since
joining
the
london
side
from
northampton
this
summer
on
a
oneyear
daily
mirror
we
have
not
yet
offered
matt
a
new
contract
but
we
will
be
doing
and
i
think
hes
good
enough
to
play
for
another
couple
of
years
dawson
played
a
vital
part
in
englands
world
cup
win
last
year
but
has
fallen
out
of
favour
with
new
coach
andy
robinson
after
missing
a
training
session
in
will
help
him
regain
his
england
theres
still
a
burning
desire
within
me
to
play
the
best
rugby
i
possibly
can
he
was
given
the
chance
i
could
play
for
england
strong
enough
im
skilful
use
sundays
return
heineken
cup
clash
with
wasps
as
a
further
springboard
to
an
england
recall
for
the
six
to
the
thisisanumber
world
cup
has
been
in
good
form
in
the
tigers
resurgence
this
play
for
england
healey
told
the
happens
after
the
previous
autumn
tests
but
when
i
look
at
the
current
squad
i
definitely
feel
there
is
a
place
there
for
me
healey
who
has
also
played
both
halfback
positions
and
fullback
during
his
career
has
reverted
to
the
wing
where
he
won
most
of
his
england
in
his
back
sustained
at
the
end
of
september
the
thisisanumber
is
relishing
his
role
in
the
tigers
fortunately
i
have
resumed
the
sort
of
form
i
had
before
he
best
suits
or
fullback
at
a
moments
gives
me
a
bigger
free
role
to
come
in
where
i
am
not
expected
and
influence
things
that
has
been
apparent
in
parts
one
and
two
of
the
waspsleicester
trilogy
in
recent
with
an
angled
run
to
score
an
injurytime
try
that
earned
the
tigers
a
thisisanumber
draw
in
their
premiership
meeting
on
thisisanumber
heineken
cup
double
header
last
sunday
healey
slotted
in
at
standoff
and
delivered
a
superb
crosskick
for
martin
corry
to
score
the
tigers
third
of
phases
before
that
and
was
hoping
to
get
it
to
him
on
the
full
but
fortunately
even
with
the
bounce
he
managed
to
score
healey
believes
last
sundays
match
was
up
there
with
some
of
the
biggest
club
contests
he
has
played
and
a
very
destructive
game
he
of
rugby
played
but
it
was
a
great
game
to
be
involved
we
might
stride
away
with
it
but
wasps
really
came
back
into
it
and
in
the
last
couple
of
minutes
it
could
have
gone
either
waythe
same
outcome
this
sunday
would
put
leicester
in
pole
position
to
top
their
heineken
pool
with
a
home
game
against
biarritz
and
away
trip
to
calvisano
to
summon
the
same
desire
if
they
are
to
deliver
the
knockout
blow
in
what
has
been
dubbed
rugbys
version
of
rocky
in
the
dressing
room
aftewards
but
it
is
really
only
a
case
of
a
job
half
done
he
twoleg
trip
and
if
we
lose
at
welford
road
it
will
negate
all
the
positives
we
can
take
from
who
wanted
it
more
and
in
the
end
i
think
we
same
desire
again

than
saturdays
epic
in

can
the
welsh
revival
continue
all
the
way
to
a
first
grand
slam
since
thisisanumber
those
are
the
two
questions
occupying
not
just
wales
supporters
but
rugby
fans
as
a
whole
after
a
scintillating
display
in
of
two
of
three
grand
slamwinning
sides
of
the
thisisanumber
hailed
it
as
one
of
the
great
performances
of
the
past
three
the
day
called
it
one
of
the
most
surreal
games
i
have
ever
played
simply
observed
there
was
a
french
half
and
there
was
a
welsh
for
the
red
dragonhood
transforming
a
thisisanumber
halftime
deficit
into
an
thisisanumber
lead
within
five
mesmerising
minutes
of
the
second
showed
the
swelling
selfbelief
of
a
side
prepared
to
back
its
own
spirit
of
adventure
the
final
quarter
told
us
a
whole
lot
more
about
this
welsh
in
the
first
halfhour
to
first
stem
the
tide
before
halftime
then
reverse
it
on
the
resumption
was
remarkable
wave
of
french
pressure
in
a
nailbiting
final
five
minutes
wales
showed
not
only
their
physical
attributes
but
their
mental
top
seven
sides
can
beat
each
other
on
a
given
day
but
the
great
sides
are
those
that
win
the
close
contests
on
a
consistent
disappointments
en
route
to
world
cup
glory
the
pain
of
defeat
forging
bonds
that
ultimately
led
to
victory
when
it
really
before
they
can
be
remotely
considered
in
a
similar
previously
on
the
receiving
end
are
learning
how
to
emerge
on
the
right
side
of
the
on
saturday
were
also
involved
when
wales
were
trounced
thisisanumber
in
paris
two
years
shackles
against
new
zealand
in
the
thisisanumber
world
cup
wales
have
rediscovered
much
of
what
made
them
a
great
rugby
nation
in
the
first
been
building
and
building
since
the
world
cup
and
we
now
have
young
players
who
are
becoming
world
class
noted
coach
mike
jenkins
dwayne
peel
and
gavin
henson
are
certainly
building
strong
cases
for
inclusion
on
this
summers
lions
tour
to
new
williams
shane
williams
and
gareth
thomas
are
proving
it
is
not
only
the
youngsters
that
are
on
an
upward
observed
that
we
are
a
very
happy
camp
of
the
credit
for
that
ensuring
the
tribal
and
regional
divisions
that
have
often
scarred
welsh
rugby
do
not
extend
to
the
national
magical
secondhalf
spell
in
paris
also
stems
from
a
style
of
play
that
first
wooed
supporters
the
world
over
in
the
attacking
exuberance
wales
have
produced
in
this
championship
they
would
not
be
contemplating
the
debris
of
three
consecutive
alone
does
not
win
matches
and
that
forward
power
mental
toughness
and
good
decisionmaking
under
pressure
are
equally
have
not
won
on
their
last
three
will
go
into
overdrive
the
players
will
set
about
the
task
of
beating
ireland
to
finish
can
they
start
thinking
about
emulating
the
hallowed
players
of
the
thisisanumber
and
writing
their
own
names
into
welsh
not
thinking
of
winning
the
grand
slam
despite
a
third
six
nations
minds
at
the
moment
said
williams
a
second
half
replacement
in
saturdays
thisisanumber
win
over
france
in
task
it
is
to
go
up
to
scotland
and
beat
of
times
recently
so
our
focus
is
on
that
game
and
well
worry
about
ireland
hopefully
after
weve
beaten
scotland
with
captain
gareth
thomas
ruled
out
of
the
rest
of
the
campaign
with
a
broken
thumb
williams
is
vying
for
his
first
start
in
the
championship
so
replace
thomas
at
fullback
leaving
williams
and
hal
luscombe
to
battle
for
the
right
wing
opportunity
to
make
a
third
successive
start
but
the
dragons
winger
is
expected
to
be
fit
for
the
trip
to
murrayfield
on
thisisanumber
picking
up
a
knee
injury
in
paris
but
centre
sonny
parker
and
flanker
colin
charvis
are
set
to
recover
from
injury
to
be
in
contention
for
theyve
worked
through
the
weekend
and
the
reports
are
a
bit
more
and
that
adds
to
the
depth
of
the
squad
scotland
secured
their
first
win
of
the
campaign
on
saturday
by
grinding
out
an
thisisanumber
win
over
in
attack
but
johnson
insisted
the
scots
will
be
difficult
opposition
to
break
sometimes
its
very
hard
to
win
he
just
as
effective
as
a
thisisanumber
or
thisisanumber
point
very
underrated
so
were
not
taking
anything
for
of
winning
our
first
three
our
to
make
sure
were
love
to
succeed
andy
farrell
as
great
britain
skipper
if
the
wigan
star
does
switch
codes
to
rugby
and
took
the
st
helens
captaincy
from
chris
joynt
last
i
make
no
bones
about
it
sculthorpe
told
bbc
was
offered
to
methe
thisisanumber
who
captained
st
helens
to
challenge
cup
success
last
year
said
following
in
the
footsteps
of
farrell
would
be
a
to
follow
but
its
something
im
confident
of
being
up
to
he
young
players
who
are
pushing
for
places
anywaysculthorpe
said
the
rugby
league
world
would
understand
if
farrell
did
decide
to
move
to
rugby
have
to
make
of
it
what
you
can
said
does
go
hes
done
everything
in
the
game
of
rugby
for
then
who
could
fault
him
sculthorpe
also
called
on
the
rugby
league
authorities
to
have
a
serious
look
at
the
number
of
games
the
top
players
are
being
asked
to
teammate
has
expressed
doubts
about
his
international
future
i
think
seans
situation
is
to
do
with
the
sheer
number
of
games
were
playing
he
is
that
if
he
can
extend
his
career
by
a
couple
of
years
by
not
playing
international
rugby
then
hes
willing
to
do
something
about
the
year
and
its
too
that
ive
suffered
with
over
the
last
couple
of
years
have
come
about
because
of
the
lack
of
rest
time
st
helens
have
been
strongly
linked
with
a
move
for
brilliant
young
forward
sonny
bill
williams
and
sculthorpe
said
he
would
love
the
thisisanumber
to
come
to
knowsley
strong
lad
who
can
certainly
hit
hard
in
defence
but
who
is
also
very
skilful
he
st
you
want
the
best
players
in
your
team
and
hes
certainly
one
of
the
best
players
in
the
rushed
into
making
a
bid
for
andy
farrell
should
the
great
britain
rugby
league
captain
decide
to
switch
the
process
are
still
some
way
away
from
going
to
the
next
stage
tigers
boss
john
wells
told
bbc
radio
a
lot
of
unknowns
about
andy
farrell
not
least
his
medical
going
to
take
a
big
big
gamble
farrell
who
has
had
persistent
knee
problems
had
an
operation
on
his
knee
five
weeks
ago
and
is
expected
to
be
out
for
another
three
head
the
list
of
rugby
union
clubs
interested
in
signing
farrell
if
he
decides
to
move
to
the
thisisanumber
union
wells
believes
he
would
better
off
playing
in
the
backs
at
least
step
between
league
and
union
by
being
involved
in
the
centre
said
to
progress
to
a
position
in
the
back
row
where
they
can
make
use
of
some
of
his
rugby
league
skills
within
the
he
can
cross
that
have
to
be
struck
between
the
cost
of
that
gamble
and
the
option
of
bringing
in
a
readymade
does
not
expect
a
quick
solution
to
the
ongoing
saga
of
captain
andy
farrells
possible
switch
to
rugby
chase
for
the
player
but
lindsay
told
the
bbc
it
was
not
yet
a
done
union
the
league
the
individual
club
and
the
england
coaching
team
have
a
say
so
its
not
a
quick
decision
he
so
if
he
wants
to
go
wed
support
him
the
prospect
of
farrell
switching
codes
has
been
the
main
talking
point
of
the
super
league
season
so
of
the
blue
to
us
admitted
to
the
club
so
theres
no
question
that
hes
deserting
move
would
be
a
lucrative
one
for
both
farrell
and
wigan
lindsay
said
money
was
not
a
motivating
factor
for
the
been
concluded
but
its
not
the
point
for
wigan
he
told
radio
five
been
a
problem
for
under
the
salary
cap
we
cant
spend
a
penny
of
it
anyway
wed
rather
have
the
playerlindsay
also
said
he
understood
why
rugby
union
was
so
interested
in
signing
up
us
but
a
great
boost
for
them
said
the
warriors
so
long
and
has
demonstrated
so
many
attributes
that
you
need
to
make
it
in
a
tough
contact
martin
johnson
dont
come
along
very
whilst
youve
got
way
through
a
tough
draw
if
they
are
to
win
the
rugby
world
cup
sevens
in
hong
kong
next
against
samoa
france
italy
georgia
and
chinese
pool
qualify
but
england
could
face
thisisanumber
winners
new
zealand
in
the
quarterfinals
if
they
stumble
against
a
together
with
the
all
the
international
rugby
board
world
sevens
series
in
dubai
but
have
slipped
to
fourth
in
the
table
after
failing
to
build
on
that
recent
los
angeles
sevens
before
losing
to
argentina
in
the
to
win
this
world
cup
and
create
sporting
history
by
being
the
only
nation
to
hold
both
the
thisisanumber
and

cups
at
the
same
time
said
england
sevens
coach
mike

have
won
there
the
last
three
years
but
the

is
on
a
different

we
will
have
to
work
hard
to
ensure
we
progress
from
our
our
true
potential
so
far
in
the
irb
sevens
which
has
been
disappointing
but
we
can
only
look
forward
england
won
the
first
rugby
world

in

with
a
side
that
included
the

than
just
a

of

drifting
up
from

in

to
be

had
edged
the

the
crescendo
rose
to

the
outcome
of

fell
to

had
seen

fall
agonisingly
under

bar
would
have
approached
with

i
looked
at

he
gave
me
a
reassuring
nod
said
positively
relished
the
responsibility
and
the
chance
to
make
himself

that
ended
five

took
the
kick
he
said
later
his

so
it
wasnt
a

there
were
still
four
minutes
for
wales
to

the

was
such
that

could
not
even

case
at

they

was
another

the

was
also
a

to
hold

from
scoring

was
slowly
at
full
steam
to
suck
in
a
few
more

him
hard
very
hard
and
then
wrestled
the
ball
away
for
a
crucial
display
with

coach
mike

taking
a
bow
at
the
showed
that
ireland
have
moved
games
but
it
is
defence
that
wins
straight
six
nations
defeat
with
a
stirring
victory
at
lansdowne
odriscoll
and
thisisanumber
points
from
ronan
ogara
kept
ireland
on
track
for
their
first
grand
slam

tries
from

thisisanumber
matches
since
the
thisisanumber
world
cup
run

five

thisisanumber
years
on
they
share
top
spot
in
the
table
on
maximum
points

ghosts
of

victors
in

the
grand
slam
at
lansdowne
crowd
on

dry
but
blustery
day
in

ireland
tore
into
the
whiteshirted
visitors
from
the
kickoff
and
made
their
intentions
clear
when
ogara
landed
a
fourthminute
but
their
first
real
venture
into
irelands
half
produced
a
simple
score
for
ball
from
the
back
of
a
ruck
and
found
an
absence
of
green
jerseys
between
himself
and
the
irish
line
racing
thisisanumber
yards
to
touch
conversion
from
out
on
the
left
but
almost
immediately
ogara
winning
his
thisisanumber
cap
answered
with
two
penalties
in
quick
their
own
on
the
halfway
line
after
thisisanumber
minutes
and
hodgson
the
villain
at
twickenham
coolly
bisected
the
periods
of
tactical
kicking
but
it
was
ireland
who
were
showing
more
willingness
to
spread
the
ball
wide
to
their
eager
and
inventive
the
talismanic
odriscoll
back
from
hamstring
injury
resulted
in
a
penalty
but
ireland
chose
to
kick
for
recycled
back
to
ogara
who
stroked
his
second
dropgoal
this
time
off
the
right
lewsey
was
the
catalyst
for
englands
most
promising
touchline
and
hodgsons
crosskick
put
in
mark
cueto
for
an
apparent
score
but
the
sale
wing
was
ruled
to
have
started
in
front
of
the
and
had
ireland
pinned
in
their
own
rare
irish
breakout
awarded
ogara
a
kick
at
goal

with

over
in

corner
and
touching
down
close
to

put
ireland
nine

game
at

england

a

it
us
two

it
was
not

i
know
what
can

come

by

not

for

andrew
told

theres
no
doubt
about
that
but
he
might
be
fit
for

the

has
not
played
for

since
the

world

wasted
a

are

also
blamed
englands
poor
run
of
recent
results
on
a
lack
of
leadership
in
the
side
following
several
highprofile
retirements
and
that

obviously
huge
losses

is
so
important

well
as

you
shut
out
all

putting
the

hodgson

an
excellent
kicking
record

sharks

i
just
hope
that

knows
that
the

for
the
following
game
against

said
and
i
cant
just
drag
my

around
if
i
dont
get

it
looks
a
definite
headtohead

between

you

as
far
back
as

seen
him
come

reffed
with

do

there

i

the

when

thumped

it

put
the

in
the
court
but
despite
his
defeat
the
world
number
thisisanumber
was
pleased
with

for
me
its
really
positive
to

i
said
that
because
i
didnt

that
her

may
be
over
with
the
player
having
already
endured
an
operation
earlier
in
the
season
to
cure
her
wrist
im
pessimistic
said
bruno
fellow

lleyton
hewitt
in

but
the

split
for
private
reasons
back
in
to
taylor
dent
in
the
quarterfinals
of
the
australian
hardcourt
championships
in
adelaide
on
favourite
for
the
title
but
went
down
thisisanumber

thisisanumber
to
the
next
after
the
fourth
seed
was
too
strong
for
jurgen

thisisanumber
thisisanumber

and
will
take

by
beating

thisisanumber
the
ball
much
better
said
lot
of
break
chances
i
didnt
take
care
of
them
all
but
i
broke
him
four
times
and
he
only
broke
me
to
get
up
in
the
set
that
she
and
sister
venus
are
a
declining
force
in
a
grand
slam
title
for
the
first
time
since
fading
saying
thats
not
fair
im
tired
of
not
saying
got
to
the
wimbledon
done
that
while
serena
is
through
to
the
australian
open
semifinals
venus
went
out
in
the
fourth
round
meaning
she
has
not
gone
further
than
the
last
eight
in
her
last
five
grand
slam
severe
strain
in
her
but
i
didnt
tear
it
the
way
she
i
wouldnt
have
been
that
just
played
out
of
her
mind
and
venus
made
some
errors
that
she
probably
shouldnt
have
made
serena
also
said
people
tended
to
forget
the
impact
the
thisisanumber
murder
of
sister
yetunde
price
had
had
on
the
a
very
very
very
very
very
close
family
serena
weve
been
placed
in
in
the
past
little
over
a
year
its
not
easy
to
come
out
and
just
perform
at
your
best
when
you
realize
there
are
so
many
things
that
are
so
tournament
to
prove
and
i
know
that
im
one
of
the
best
players
out
place
in
the
last
thisisanumber
of
the
australian
open
with
a
convincing
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
win
over
nicole
vaidisova
of
the
czech
for
her
thisisanumber
opponent
breaking
twice
in
the
first
set
and
once
in
the
times
but
was
unable
to
find
a
way
back
after
falling
behind
thisisanumber
in
the
opening
ace
plays
karolina
sprem
in
the
next
opponent
and
was
able
to
play
well
enough
to
get
through
it
said
some
inexperience
played
a
role
in
has
a
big
game
and
has
many
many
years
to
improve
on
that
sprem
the
croatian
thisisanumber
seed
saw
off
russias
elena
likhovtseva
thisisanumber
into
the
fourth
round
with
a
straight
sets
win
over
anna
with
williams
until
thisisanumber
in
the
first
set
before
it
became
oneway
but
was
still
good
enough
to
romp
through
the
contest
in
exactly
an
to
finish
a
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
first
australian
to
win
her
home
title
since
chris

at

event
when
she
beat
unseeded
russian
nadia
petrova
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
to
reach
the
fourth
grew
in
confidence
and
won
in
just
thisisanumber
was
nice
to
get
through
in
straight
sets
we
were
destined
to
meet
i
guess
williams
said
referring
to
her
match
with

by
that

it
was
going

that
easy
mirza
said
after
her
second
round
round
so
relieved
there
was
no
pressure
tennis
is
not
a
particularly
popular
sport
in
india
but
a
number
of
indians
watched
the
live
telecast
of
the
match
between
mirza
and
indian
city
of
hyderabad
known
for
producing
a
host
of
top
indian
cricketers
turned
professional
two
years
small
when
she
went
for
her
first
tennis
classes
as
a
sixyearold
parents
up
and
said
the
way
she
hits
the
ball
ive
never
seen
a
sixyearold
hit
a
ball
like
that
mirza
told
the
associated
tested
positive
for
a
banned
drug
according
to
belgian
that
the
russian
world
number
five
tested
positive
for
the
stimulant
ephedrine
on
thisisanumber
event
in
charleroi
at
the
be
tested
again
the
situation
remains
unclear
as
the
tournament
was
not
commissioned
by
the
world
antidoping
agency
wada
the
international
tennis
federation
itf
or
the
womens
tennis
accosiation
regional
belgian
authorities
and
kuznetsova
has
not
yet
been
able
to
have
a
b
sample
monday
before
eerdekens
identified
her
kuznetsova
said
im
not
any
positive
test
and
i
think
it
is
unfair
that
its
come
out
the
way
it
did
eerdekens
said
that
confirmation
of
the
findings
was
sent
last
friday
to
the
players
address
in
spain
as
well
as
to
the
belgian
prosecutors
office
and
the
belgian
and
russian
tennis
a
medicine
which
contained
the
banned
he
to
impose
the
disciplinary
measures
after
a
procedure
that
respects
the
improve
her
performance
or
it
is
because
she
took
some
medicine
legitimately
to
cure
an
infection
however
kuznetsovas
naming
was
condemned
by
russian
tennis
chief
shamil
minister
has
broken
every
ethical
rule
in
the
book
by
naming
a
player
without
any
proof
of
wrongdoing
without
any
basic
evidence
tarpishchev
in
doping
then
they
should
notify
the
international
tennis
federation
itf
as
well
as
the
national
federation
within
three
days
he
received
any
statement
from
the
doping
officials
nor
did
the
and
they
told
me
they
know
nothing
about
was
behind
the
testing
then
we
would
also
have
known
something
by
as
pure
fiction
and
fabrication
of
the
cup
tennis
has
left
the
british
team
with
a
gargantuan
void
to
for
fourth
among
his

in

i
doubt
greg
rusedski
will
be
that
far
behind
him

without
their

where
does
that

in

has
singled
out
alex

and
has
played
just
two

losing

list
and
yet
to
make
his

was
right
for
him
to
step
down

let
the

britains
next

hardly

against

of

inevitable
with

lining
up

replace

the
