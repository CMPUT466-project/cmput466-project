when

we
have
already
taken

she
said
new

that
many

it
now
is

were
announced
by

recycling

would
announce
their

closer
to
the

said
while

would
welcome
any
extra
maternity

the
liberal
democrats
feel
this
money
is
being
misdirected
she
said
her
party
would
boost
maternity
pay
in
the
first
six
months
to
allow
more

in
that

unlikely
to
have
been
a

mr

the

was
not
about

or
the
destruction
of
important
to
look
at
how
the
email
regime
could
support
the
freedom
of

of
parliament
makes
it
very
clear
that
to
destroy
records
in
order
to
prevent
their
disclosure
becomes
a
criminal
offence
he
said
there
was
already
clear
guidance
on
the
retention
of

contained
in
a

of
practice
from
the

but
the
important
thing
was
the

of

mr

the
longstanding
principle
of
the
civil

and
public
further
use
for

it
may
be
legitimate
to
destroy

we

what
we
are
talking

the
fact
that
about
six
out
of
thisisanumber
women
work
in
jobs
that
are
lowpaid

typically
dominated
by

so
we
have
got
very
segregated
very
oldfashioned
and
stereotypical
ideas
about
the
appropriate
jobs
for

or
indeed
for

for

where
only
thisisanumber

really
a

there

you

that
whether

it

result
in

also

as

mr

he
was
a
courteous

kind
and
rather
dashing

i

was

if
there
had
there
been

on

his

youre
not
allowed
to
put
a
view
forward
if
you
happen
to
be

from

that
seems
to
me
an
absolutely
extraordinary
proposition
it
would
certainly
mean
no

from

could
be

presents
the

tells
cockerell
that
she
despaired
at

image
when
he
was

hed

would
put

shows

impression

he
calls

mr

said
it

better
if

mr

believed
the

had
been

to
more
than
thisisanumber
secondary
pupils
from

in

about
the
problems
of

by
the
scottish
national
party
which
accused
him
of
encouraging
young
people
to
get
mr
mcconnell
was
speaking
about
adults
and
his
comments
were
a
recognition
that
people
will
get
scotsman
said
i
think
we
have
to
say
right
at
the
outset
that
this
was
a
very
stupid
and
illadvised
remark
by
the
first
like
this
saying
that
by
all
means
get
drunk
then
you
will
be
pilloried
for
it
however
he
added
that
perhaps
mr
mcconnell
could
feel
rightly
aggrieved
about
the
problem
here
is
that
he
did
say
a
lot
more
things
about
binge
drinking
and
under
age
has
been
lost
in
the
furore
over
one
there
is
a
much
bigger
message
here
that
has
been
obscured
mr
law
from
voluntary
body
alcohol
focus
scotland
believed
damage
had
been
done
to
scotlands
fight
against
binge
people
drank
and
they
did
have
problems
with
remark
was
illadvised
but
these
remarks
are
blown
out
of
all
proportion
and
they
so
easily
misrepresent
what
we
are
trying
to
do
in
young
people
but
we
need
to
acknowledge
that
they
do
drink
issues
which
are
about
promoting
responsibility
and
reducing
harm
and
indeed
tackling
our
drinking
culture
which
is
a
culture
about
binge
drinking
and
drunkenness
he
said
it
was
vital
that
young
people
were
properly
informed
about
the
risks
incurred
to
themselves
and
others
when
they
got
minister
should
know
by
now
that
if
he
said
things
which
were
off
the
mark
they
were
bound
to
come
back
and
bite
talking
in
the
highlands
to
thisisanumber
teenagers
and
every
word
he
said
was
put
out
on
a
webcast
by
the
scottish
executive
and
then
looked
at
by
other
politicians
and
has
done
a
lot
of
really
good
things

to

they
say
these

weve

to
tell
you
the

weve

is
pretty
to
the

the

you
should
warn

why
he
thought
the

were
not
there
lord

said
one
has
got
to
remember
what
the
purpose
of
the

to
persuade
the
british
why
the

thought
iraq
was
a
very
serious
threatwhen
asked
whether
he
thought
the
country
was
wellgoverned
on
the
whole
he
replied
where
we
suffer
very
badly
from
parliament
not
having
sufficient
control
over
the
executive
and
that
is
a
very
grave
the
party
to
bring
in
a
huge
number
of
extremely
bad
bills
a
huge
amount
of
regulation
and
to
do
whatever
it
likes

what

a

in

at

said
the

had
not

it
was
likely
to

and
because
it
was

mr

would
make
the
official
announcement
in

debate
on

and
the

have
volunteered

instead
of

said
it

found
wide
support
among
criminal

professionals
for
an
end
to
the
mandatory

sentence
for

could
be
graded
to
recognise
the
seriousness
of
the

sentences
would
not
be
abolished
and
argued
courts
already
had
two
judges
a
senior
barrister
and
sentencing
experts
had
been
asked
to
consider
reforms
to
the
defence
of
provocation
in
murder
unlikely
to
work
without
a
far
wider
review
of
the
thisisanumber
respondents
out
of

among

thisisanumber
judges
believed
a
mandatory

sentence
for
every
murder
was
indefensible
and
should
category
should
continue
to
cover
all
types
of
murder
from
mercy
killings
to
serial
or
contract
idea
of
grading
murders
so
that
the
sentence
reflected
the
seriousness
of
the
published
home
office
minister
baroness
scotland
said
murder
is
the
most
serious
of
crimes
and
we
have
no
intention
of
abolishing
the
mandatory
life
murder
the
court
must
pass
a
life
sentence
the
commission
also
recommended
tightening
the
law
so
that
the
provocation
defence
cannot
be
used

cases
where
someone
has
killed
for

had

questions
were

his
dual
guard

a
perception

a
that
no

he

nothing

he

foreign
doesnt

there
he
thinks
the

secretarys
weak
he

the

doesnt

strategically
and
he
thinks
the

secretary
hasnt
developed
as
like
being
told
the
truth
and
the
chancellor
no
doubt
the
prime
minister
will
agree
with
this
is
a
bully
mr

retorted
voters
remembered
the
record

no

was
wrong
to
give
the

to
stay
in

round
of

for

students
studying

by

in
an
attempt

prevent
a
crossborder
flood
although
no
figure
has
yet
been
in
england
is
not
due
to
take
effect
until
autumn
thisisanumber
and
students
who
start
before
then
will
not
have
to
pay
additional
fees
at
thursday
by
admissions
service
claimed
that
an
increase
in
applications
did
not
amount
to
scottish
students
being
squeezed
could
be
applying
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
possible
increase
in
annual
fees
at
english
universities
but
this
was
not
a
major
morning
scotland
programme
the
reason
people
are
opting
for
scottish
universities
is
that
they
are
perceived
as
being
of
very
high
quality
they
offer
very
attractive
courses
and
scotland
is
seen
as
a
very
attractive
place
to
up
their
studies
in
thisisanumber
they
will
be
hit
by
topup
fees
if
they
are
going
to
a
university
in
england
and
that
may
be
part
of
the
reason
why
the
numbers
coming
to
scotland
are
so
we
will
see
thousands
of
additional
students
from
england
studying
here
mr
wallace
agreed
and
said
the
figures
had
to
be
looked
at
in
translated
into
acceptances
the
number
was
not
huge
an
additional
figure
of
about
by
the
fact
that
applications
from
wales
where
there
are
no
plans
for
topup
fees
have
also
risen
by
all
parts
of
the
world
does
show
the
high
regard
in
which
scottish
higher
education
is
held
not
just
in
when
students
are
making
their
choice
they
do
so
on
the
nature
of
the
course
and
not
because
they
are
under
some
sort
of
financial
pressure
to
go
to
a
situation
where
it
becomes
impossible
for
scottish
students
to
get
places
at
scottish
universities
because
we
are
seen
as
the
cheap
university
experience
is
enhanced
by
the
fact
there
are
students
coming
from
a
wide
range
of
backgrounds
so
it
would
be
wrong
to
go
the
other
way
and
start
excluding
prosecuted
under
plans
to
crack
down
on
animal
cruelty
a
committee
of
mps
has
welfare
bill
could
leave
anglers
facing
court
even
though
it
was
not
intended
the
environment
select
committee
the
government
had
not
consulted
directly
on
its
plans
to
improve
animal
which
needed
to
be
resolved
mps
that
the
government
consults
on
any
plans

regulate

and
improve
animal
welfare
legislation
and
intends
to
protect
kept
animals
and
companion
animals
by
setting
up
a
duty
of

it
creates
an
offence
of
neglect
by

who
fail
to
protect

animals
for
whom
they
are

best
recommendations
after
hearing
evidence
from
thisisanumber
organisations
and
the

so
that
prosecutions
against
those
engaged
in
fishing
were
not
inadvertently
encouraged
even
if
they
were
to
later
nor
recreational
angling
should
fall
within
the

of
the
of

and
we
therefore
support

exempt

as
an
activitybut
the
committee
said
an
amendment
was
needed
to
ensure

be
careful
to
ensure
that
those
persons
who
catch

are
not
given
carte
blanche
to
inflict
unnecessary
suffering
in
the
course
of
pursuing
this
activity
the
committee
protections
for

were
downgraded
by
the
bill
such
as
the
law
on
abandonment
of
animals
which
would
be
significantly
clauses
relating
to
the
prosecution
of
cruelty
the
draft
bill
would
allow
certain
acts
that
should
be
prosecuted
such
as
unnecessary
suffering
caused
to
an
animal
through
neglect
or
unnecessary
mental
suffering
to
go
change
in
the
law
as
it
affects
animals
always
arouses
powerful
emotions
and
great
public
an
approach
to
animal
welfare
which
doesnt
just
wait
for
a
problem
to
occur
but
enables
action
to
be
taken
to
protect
animals
before
irreversible
suffering
takes
place
but
mr
jack
said
the
bill
very
much
had
the
feel
of
a
work
in
progress
and
urged
the
government
to
guarantee
that
an
obligation
to
consult
will
be
enshrined
in
law
before
it
extended
legislative
plans
to
areas
such
as
pet
fairs
circuses
and
game
bird
take
the
rough
edges
of
its
initial
proposals
before
the
bill
is
introduced
to
parliament
he
vowed
to
plough
on
with
plans
for
id
cards
despite
a
call
for
him
to
pause
for
thought
from
charles
blunketts
resignation
was
a
good
opportunity
to
question
whether
the
legislation
was
supported
the
plans
when
mr
blunkett
argued
for
them
in
cabinet
and
he
supported
them
creating
a
more
secure
society
he
was
introduced
remained
a
matter
for
debate
but
he
said
legislation
had
already
been
significantly
influenced
by
the

of

next

he
also

said
the
us
government
was
suspicious
of
the
motives
of
some
other
countries
within
the
eu
in
wanting
the

objections
were
based
on
a
lack
of

and
understanding
of
how
export
control
guidelines
worked
in

with
us
officials
to
convince

it
was
the

thing
to
would
lead
to
a

that
could

political

have
sparked
calls
for
a

says
it
is
worth
debating
a
thisisanumber
cap
for
the
future
but
now
is
not
the
right
time
to
introduce
more
state
funding
for
political
parties
and
candidates
should
be
able
to
spend
more
on
election
donations
to
political

in
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
and
thisisanumber
with
nearly
thisisanumber
of
them
from
individual
gifts
worth
more
than
so
the
public
can
see
who
gives
how
much
to
the
parties
but
the
report
says
there
are
still
public
mean
taxpayers
giving
parties
more
cash
something
which
would
first
have
to
be
acceptable
to
the
public
and
shown
to
opposed
to
the
introduction
of
a
donation
cap
we
do
not
believe
that
such
a
major
departure
from
the
existing
system
now
would
be
sensible
says
its
cap
it
should
be
thisisanumber
a
small
enough
amount
to
make
a
difference
but
which
would
have
banned
thisisanumber
in
donations
between
thisisanumber
and
urge
political
parties
to
seek
out
more
smallscale
donations
and
suggests
there
should
be
income
tax
relief
for

under

the

with

there
is
no
doubt
that
political

have
a
vital
role
to
play
in
maintaining
the
health
of
our
democracy
and
for
this
they
need
to

adequately

politics

that
they
want

to

more
visible

at

unhappy
with

the

the

that

perhaps
then
others
would
listen
to
us

dr

the

what

referred
to
as
the

the

the

i
think

drop

be
sufficient
to
satisfy

in

detailed

i
believe
that
what
i
announced
yesterday
will
be
sufficient
to
secure

further

that

thuggish

brutal
in

i
dont

actually
if
you
read
what
he
said
although
it
was
extraordinary
and
rude
i
dont

was
actually

mr

said
they
would
help
smash

smuggling
on

all

put

at

needed
to
be

to

of

mr

said
its
not

as
some
people
to
claim
to
talk
about
controlling

far
from
it
he
said
that
coming
from

himself
he
recognised
that
firm
but
fair

were
essential

there

and
we
have
very
clear

that
it

the

said
the

always
asked

they

in

with
the
are
not

a

for

commissioners
office
said
it
would
be
classed
as

if
political

telephoned

to

people
about

if
they
recorded

only
as

of
a
bigger
set
of

not

by
that
than
it
may
be
that
also
would
not
be

he
considered
unsolicited
marketing
if
a

recorded
voting
preferences
with
a
view
to
marketing
information
in
the
yes
or
no

and
the
area
was
pretty
we
would

lib
dem
chairman
matthew
taylor
has
now
written
to
the

saying
the
advice
we
have
received
on
several
previous
occasions
is
that
such
phone
calls
are
illegal
he
says
evidence
from
local
lib
dem
parties
around
the
country
suggests
there
are
significant
numbers
of
such
swift
and
efficient
action
to
ensure
that
this
ceases
he
tells
the
new
guidelines
so
all
parties
can
act
in
the
same
way
if
the

believes
the
rules
allow
parties
to
ring
tps
numbers
about

and
later
urge
those
people
to

for

when

greatly
concerned

whats
happening
round
about
them
mr
mcconnell
said
he
regularly
saw
reports
on
the
effects
of
binge
drinking
sprees
which
ended
in
assaults
or
even
rapes
and
on
the
health
consequences
of
binge
to
do
something
really
serious
about
is
binge
drinking
and
irresponsible
drinks
promotions
that
can
help
lead
to
that
he
particular
are
selling
far
too
much
booze
far
too
cheaply
and
encouraging
people
to
drink
it
far
too
on
that
and
make
those
promotions
illegal
in
the
hope
that
people
can
enjoy
a
drink
sensibly
over
the
course
of
an
eveninghe
added
by
all
means
get
drunk
once
in
a
while
but
do
not
get
into
a
situation
where
people
are
being
encouraged
to
get
completely
incapable
just
to
save
some
money
and
drink
more
quickly
snp
holyrood
leader
nicola
sturgeon
said
this
is
an
incredible
gaffe
by
jack
is
an
issue
in
scotland
but
it
is
quite
staggering
that
any
politician
particularly
the
first
minister
should
encourage
young
people
to
get
remarks
immediately
but
an
executive
spokeswoman
insisted
mr
mcconnell
had
made
the
remark
with
adults
not
youngsters
in
of
adults
binge
drinking
and
irresponsible
drinks
promotions
which
are
for
the
thisisanumber
she
people
will
get
drunk
but
that
binge
drinking
and
drinks
promotions
that
encourage
it
are
not
leader
who
said
conflict
between
himself
and
tony
blair
was
harming
the
workings
of
servants
union
spoke
of
competing
agendas
between
mr
brown
and
mr
was
never
at
meetings
between
himself
and
the
prime
minister
so
could
not
trying
to
block
civil
service
reform
which
threatened
his
members
baumes
union
the
first
division
association
to
suggest
there
were
two
agendas
battling
against
each
other
because
the
union
was
trying
to
resist
the
planned
reforms
mr
brown
told
bbc
radio
thisisanumber
today
gershon
report
some
thisisanumber
civil
servants
jobs
will
be
axed
or
changed
and
the
savings
ploughed
back
into
frontline
i
dont
think
you
can
rely
on
his
mr
baumes
judgement
on
this
matter
when
it
comes
to
the
decisions
that
the
government
are
exactly
the
same
decisions
on
civil
service
with
the
gershon
reforms
he
also
said
that
as
mr
baume
was
never
present
at
meetings
between
himself
and
the
prime
minister
he
was
not
in
a
position
to
prebudget
report
mr
baume
told
bbc
news
there
were
sometimes
conflicting
and
competing
agendas
for
government
between
number
thisisanumber
and
the
by
any
means
what
alan
milburn
and
the
prime
minister
want
to
see
mr
baume
the
treasury
on
the
basis
of
public
service
agreements
they
sign
up
to
but
at
the
same
time
the
prime
minister
also
has
an
agenda
and
thats
not
necessarily
the
same
as
the
treasurys
and
the
prime
minister
is
of
course
a
very
powerful
figure
in
any
and
directions
to
departments
about
how
he
would
like
each
secretary
of
state
and
each
department
to
implement
a
policy
occasions
these
two
dont
add
up
and
individual
cabinet
ministers
as
well
as
departments
have
to
make
sense
of
this
battle
number
thisisanumber
said
ministers
were
interested
in
governing
and
not
a
soap
opera
about
mr
blair
and
mr
the
battle
royal
that
the
top
civil
servants
are
now
reporting
on
between
the
chancellor
and
tony
blair
is
preventing
them
both
from
getting
on
with
the
business
of
getting
taxpayers
value
for
number
of
mps
by
about
onefifth
if
they
were
elected
tory
leader
michael
howard
has
partys
smaller
government
bill
to
be
unveiled
later
this
the
party
would
also
reduce
the
number
of
government
special
be
held
in
wales
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
scrap
the
welsh
within
five
years
of
the
conservatives
winning
a
general
election
mr
howard
told
the
go
would
depend
on
the
result
of
the
welsh
referendum
but
it
would
probably
mean
a
reduction
of
around
thisisanumber
from
the
current
total
of
assembly
it
would
stand
to
lose
more
planned
to
cut
the
number
of
civil
servants
at
whitehall
labour
by
more
than
thisisanumber
and
the
tories
by
almost
thisisanumber
they
should
accept
a
similar
drop
in
their
own
government
departments
should
be
reduced
but
what
about
ministers
parliament
and
special
advisers
he
heald
said
this
will
be
part
of
our
aim
to
reduce
unnecessary
and
costly
interference
in
peoples
lives
by
reducing
the
size
and
role
of
the
also
even
out
the
great
unfairness
of
there
being
proportionately
more
scottish
and
welsh
mps
at
westminster
than
those
from
constituency
was
thisisanumber
people
mr
howard
over
thisisanumber
in
wales
just
over
thisisanumber
and
in
scotland
be
set
at
an
amount
that
was
consistent
and
fair
in
terms
of
representation
with
the
rest
of
the
united
kingdom
if
the
assembly
was
be
carried
out
quickly
and
could
even
be
implemented
by
the
election
after
big
house
of
lords
reform
getting
to
one
stage
and
then
not
having
the
next
the
uk
to
deport
terror
suspects
to
their
home
countries
without
risk
of
them
being
tortured
or
sentenced
to
times
he
hoped
agreement
with
several
countries
could
be
judgement
that
the
detention
of
thisisanumber
men
at
belmarsh
prison
london
and
woodhill
milton
keynes
was
are
from
algeria
tunisia
egypt
and
antiterror
legislation
brought
in
after
thisisanumber
september
to
hold
the
men
indefinitely
without
charge
broke
human
rights
think
we
should
be
prosecuting
much
more
energetically
our
ability
to
deport
the
individuals
concerned
to
the
countries
from
which
they
come
he
said
it
was
a
route
that
was
being
pursued
in
collaboration
with
foreign
secretary
jack
straw
in
a
very
positive
seeking
memorandums
of
understanding
between
overseas
governments
and
britain
to
ensure
suspects
would
not
be
subjected
to
the
death
penalty
on
their
think
the
solution
to
the
law
lords
judgement
for
this
government
is
in
deportations
but
they
will
have
to
do
but
the
liberal
democrats
shadow
home
secretary
mark
oaten
accused
mr
clarke
of
avoiding
the
main
issue
with
the
belmarsh
secretary
is
dodging
at
this
stage
is
to
deal
with
the
very
principle
to
deal
with
how
we
tackle
this
problem
in
the
future
he
told
bbc
grasp
those
issues
and
that
means
looking
at
how
we
can
actually
secure
convictions
in
this
country
allowing
for
example
intercept
communications
telephone
tapping
to
be
included
mr
oaten
but
i
want
to
see
a
wider
debate
urgently
about
how
we
can
actually
get
trials
and
convictions
in
this
country
unless
we
get
that
the
liberal
democrats
will
vote
against
this
measure
when
it
comes
for
renewal
in
marchthe
bbcs
home
affairs
correspondent
daniel
sandford
said
it
appeared
mr
clarke
was
putting
more
emphasis
on
the
possibility
of
deportation
than
his
predecessor
david
with
some
of
the
detainees
home
countries
could
be
of
very
very
serious
crimes
in
their
home
countries
so
its
not
an
easy
agreement
to
get
and
i
think
for
some
of
these
suspects
it
wont
be
the
solution
daniel
sandford
said
ministers
may
try
to
put
forward
other
solutions
such
as
allowing
more
secret
evidence
to
be
put
into
normal
criminal
trials
or
developing
a
more
secret
trials
process
in
the
next
few
some
of
them
and
then
those
that
are
left
see
if
they
can
work
out
some
way
of
putting
them
on
trial

i
have

he
also
accepted
there
wasnt
some
conspiracy

i
just
think
a

and
we
should
move
onearlier
mr

said
there

there
was
a
strong
case

earlier
this

mr

were
not

arguing
they
would
make
the
asylum
system
fairer
for
genuine
an
annual

on

all

the

put

lives
at

if

once

no

one
in

that

are

it

staff

they
will
actually
make

said
mr

needed
to
be
a
quick
fair
and
firm
asylum
disgusting
to
propose
a
system
which
could
turn
away
genuine
risk
of
this
happening
as

for

will
be
considered
when

are
not

mr

with

the

he

will
give

the

the

ukip
whose
leadership
had
gone
awol
after
the
great
opportunity
offered
by
its
third
place
at
last
junes
european
on
the
british
people
i
shall
not

next
general
campaign
for
the

i
believe
shall
be
honest
open
and
straightmr
hockney
also
left
ukip
saying
mr
kilroysilk
would
deliver
better
as
the
leader
of
a
eurosceptic
mr
hockney
to
quit
the
london
has
a
moral
obligation
if
not
a
legal
one
to
stand
he
is
glad
to
see
the
back
of
mr
people
but
sadly
after
the
european
election
it
became
clear
that
he
was
more
interested
in
the
robert
kilroysilk
party
than
the
uk
independence
party
so
it
was
nice
knowing
him
now
goodbye
he
has
not
been
straightforward
in
attacking
the
party
he
once
wanted
to
pray
should
try
to
resolve
its
differences
with
kilroy
to
show
a
united
front
and
give
the
uk
public
a
serious
political
voice
against
view
point
just
splits
the
vote
now
ukip
at
least
has
a
chance
in
the
electionit
is
very
sad
to
see
the
cause
of
britain
regaining
its
proper
relationship
with
europe
damaged
by
this
split
within
to
and
a
damaged
must
work
together
and
small
parties
have
no
hope
of
advance
partly
and
only
partly
due
to
has
been
dissipated
in
policies
not
just
withdrawal
from
the
comments
surrounding
the
launch
of
his
own
new
party
were
interested
in
letting
him
join
them
and
take
over
their
leadership
speaks
end
for
democracy
then
he
and
the
two
assembly
members
should
resign
and
force
a
byelections
to
stand
on
their
own
platform
rather
than
this
backdoor
approach
to
politics
of
being
elected
for
one
party
then
defecting
to
him
to
lead
not
good
enough
for
him
to
followinteresting
that
a
party
committed
to
plain
speaking
should
have
a
latin
nameevery
opinion
poll
points
to
an
overwhelming
antieurope
feeling
in
this
of
something
huge
if
he
can
broaden
his
appeal
beyond
this
one
with
years
of
political
clean
and
efficient
public
transport
punishments
that
fit
the
crime
limited
asylum
a
purge
on

and
less
qualities
sadly
lacking
in
our
your
time
may
have
comewell
if
you
cannot
get
enough
limelight
being
an
ordinary
mp
then
go
out
and
start
up
your
own
policy
herelets
hope
this
is
the
start
of
both
ukip
and
kilroysilk
slipping
into
surely
all
modern
schoolchildren
will
understand
it
since
they
do
still
learn
latin
in
the
classroom
do
they
not
the
whole
essence
of
what

is
euroscepticism

how
the

no

that
in

england

the

kisrty

for

added
if
the

that

of

would
benefit
from
my
investment
of
the

five

eight
months
asked
about
waiting
lists
she
said
that
waiting
times
and
lists
were
only
thisisanumber
of
the
health
agenda
and
that
the
welsh
assembly
government
had
turned
the
corner
on
the
candidate
for
allegedly
suggesting
the
criminally

should
be

seat
in

including
the

of

sent

two
scottish
who
selected
mr

knew
nothing
of
his
time
for
ukip
soon
after
the
highprofile
departure
of

robert

that
the
organs
of
the
criminally
insane
should
be
made
available
to
lawabiding
members
of

and
proposed
the
legalisation
of

and
the
sex
for
the
resurrection
of
the
british
environmental
and
others
can
only
be
dealt
with
on
a
global
scale
and
that
calls
for
a
radical
alliance
of
the
englishspeaking
nations
which
they
are
uniquely
able
to
do
mr
croucher
said
the
main
issue
would
be
that
mr
houstons
reported
views
had
been
presented
as
ukip
policy
which
they
were
submissions
to
a
committee
working
on
the

would
not
have
been
matched

mr

was

overreacted

overshot

nielson
who
is

scotland

he
had
suspended
mr

on
friday

is
being
investigated
and
then
we
will
decide
if
and
what
further
action
will
be
taken
he
said
that
any
evidence
would
be
looked
into
and
mr
houston
may
be
interviewed
by
the
much
at
the
moment
i
have
one
version
from
him

i
havent
seen
the

instead
needed

its
own
to

than
any
other

a
sort
of
state
of
denial
about
the

result
but
predicted
a
more
receptive

would
emerge

too
he
is
there
for

chosen
him

to
take
seriously
what
he
perceives

out

of

with

only
participate

say
he

surrendering

in

gordon

will
say
as
he
sets
out

goals
for
its

thisisanumber
a
series
of
key

the

will
be
judged
on

we

of

of

particularly
in

right
through

were
effectively
a

give

there

now
an

such
as

in

unnecessarily
every

more
was
needed
including
thisisanumber
debt
relief
a
test
he
promises
the

is
not
prepared
to
honour
them
then
people
will
be
justified
in
saying
they
promised
but
they
did
not
produce
results
the

very
moderate
said
general
to

said
some
pakistanis
should
integrate
not
expect

if
they
isolated
people
think
that
the
women
should
be
confined
to
their
houses
and
put
veils
on
and
all
that
and
they
should
not
move
out
absolutely
wrong
the
pakistani
president
was
also
asked
whether
he
thought
the
war
on
terror
had
made
the
world
less
we
are
not
addressing
the
core
problems
so
therefore
we
can
never
address
it
in
its
totality
he
immediate
context
but
we
are
not
fighting
it
in
its
strategic
longterm
we
need
to
resolve
them
and
also
the
issue
of

and
extremism

that
it

the
core
of
what

what
creates
an

which
then
leads
on
to

blair

the

been
made
there
said
mr

whatever
the

a

to
fulfil
environmental
volatility
in

he
said
the

would
be
the

but
environmentalists
believe
less
duty
means
more
that
each

fuel
duties
should
rise
at

in

as
we

to

referred

his
comments
made
some

if
the

is
going

it
is
going

require
advocates
in

people
there
willing

kinnock
added
that
the
second
factor
behind
his

was
his
appointment

its

and
that
was
a
conclusive
factor
mr

he
thought
about
the

a
long
time
because
he
had
long
had
reservations
about
the

developed
substantially
but
not
sufficiently

consequently
i
did
take
all
these
factors
into

its
not
a

it

it
would
not

the
common

has
been
that

currently
the

the

to

the

says
phonetap

foreign
terror

that
if
intercept
evidence

these

could
be
brought
to
the

is
often
weak
and
can
expose
the
methods
of

not
make
much
difference
because
cases
against
terror
suspects
frequently
rely
on
other
kinds
of
to
change
the
regime
of

without

after

that

by

he
told
mr

of
his
intention
to
stand
minister
said
help
me
to
get
through
the

and
i
will
then
stand
down
but
he
then
changed
his
mind
in
june
thisisanumber
following
intervention
from
allies
in
the
cabinet
and
the
suspicion
that
the
chancellor
was
deliberately
manoeuvring
against
him
according
to
the
understanding
is
that
they
are
not
nearly
as
close
or
as
friendly
as
they
once
is
now
a
pretty
profound
mutual
mistrust
mutual
this
doubleact
pretending
everything
is
alright
but
in
private
i
dont
think
the
relationship
is
good
because
brown
understandably
feels
deeply
betrayed
particularly
over
this
issue
of
the
leadership
but
in
a
wideranging
bbc
interview
covering
issues
such
as
the
asian
tsunami
disaster
the
middle
east
peace
process
and
northern
ireland
mr
blair
said
when
you
get
to
the
top
in

you
get
this
huge
swell
around
sorts
of
claims
and
counterclaims
he
admitted
to
a
sense
of
frustration
about
the
allegations
which
he
said
had
been
made
countless

recently

their

the

should
sack
mr

but
did
not
believe
mr

was
strong
enough
to
do

mr

of
squabbling
like
adam

this
is
the

said
the
personal
ambition
of
mr

and
mr

was
getting
in
the
way
of
good
and
put
their
squabbles
to

side

they
cannot
expect

it

that
in

some
of
the

that
some
people
try
to
associate
with

boils
over

thats
the
kind
of
thing
supporters

are
very
clear
they

praised
the

for

do
want
to
identify
whether
there
are
particular
individuals
who
are
going
over

and
inciting

or
violence
they
will
crack
down
very
effectively
on
that
we
will
consider
the
introduction
of

to
give
additional
powers
to

there
are

that
the

encouraged

this
country
and
whether
they
are
entitled
to
be
in
this
country
who
does
settle
here
how
we
have
border
controls
is
a
perfectly
legitimate
aspect
of
public
debate
he
oaten
said
whilst
it
is
good
that
labour
has
rejected
the
tory
idea
of
quotas
on
asylum
the
jury
is
still
out
on
the
home
offices
ability
to
deliver
a
fair
and
efficient
asylum
systemmr
howard
has
said
britain
should
take
its
fair
share

the
worlds
genuine

with
it
britains

on
mr

to
denounce
the
suggestion
britains
hospitality
was
being
tested
by
in
the
nhs
and
the
thisisanumber
nurses
without
whom
we
would
really
see
what
pressure
on
the
health
service
means
he
australia
jamaica
who
are
reducing
the
sizes
of
our
classes
and
schools
the
refugee
council
said
mr
howards
proposals
would
mean
there
would
be
no
safe
haven
in
the
decision
not
to
release
foreign
terror
suspects
despite
a
legal
ruling
their
detention
breached
human

against
the
detention
measures
last

one
set
of
laws
for
foreign
suspects
and
another
for
british
he
would
carefully
consider
the
ruling
and
would
return
to
parliament
early
in
the
new
year
with
be
rushed
into
judgement
but
would
examine
the
law
lords
findings
in
first
of
all
the
security
of
this
country
and
in
so
doing
to
consider
very
carefully
the
precise
legal
measures
that
there
are
mr

came
in
response
to
an
emergency
question
from
liberal
democrat
constitutional
affairs
spokesman
david
unprecedented
condemnation
and
could
not
have
been
more
balance
between
the

and
human

but
questioned
why
the
home
office
had
made
no

for
the
present

not
an
option
shadow
home

david
davis
said
it
was
not
possible
to
overstate
the
importance
of
the
judgment
and
urged

move
as
fast
as
competently
possible
to
sort
the

i
will
be
asking

carefully
to
see
whether
it
is
possible
to
modify
our
legislation
to
address
the
concerns
raised
by
the
house
of
lordsbut
the
government
was
widely
criticised
for
insisting
the
detentions
would
continue
following
the
ruling
last
said
the
rules
were
incompatible
with
the
european
convention
on
human
rights
as
they
allowed
detentions
in
a
way
that
discriminates
on
the
ground
of
nationality
or
immigration
status
by
justifying
detention
without
trial
for
foreign
suspects
but
not
ruling
said
indefinite
imprisonment
without
charge
or
trial
is
anathema
in
any
country
which
observes
the
rule
of

the
detainees
took
their
case
to
the
house
of
lords
after
the

of

backed
the

powers
to
hold
them

the

unveiled
the

last

providing

by

but
advocates
say
it
ensures
effective

weak
in

said
foreign
secretary
jack
straw
after
the
question
was
of
the
cabinet
will
back
a
yes
ancram
said
the
referendum
question
seems
trying
to
confuse
the
issue
by
putting
the
eu
referendum
question
in
the
same
bill
as
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
when
they
should
be
treated
as
two
separate
said
voters
now
have
a
fundamental
lack
of
trust
of
tony
blair
as
prime
not
a
wasted
vote
adding
that
with
the
lib
dems
what
you
see
is
what
you
start
of
a
day
of
appearances
on

in
a

on
the
wright
stuff
and
the

presenter
covered
lib
dem
tax
plans
antiterror
laws
and
thisisanumber
years
in

he
had
seen
prime
ministers
and
party
leaders
come
and
go
and
knew
the
pitfalls
of
british
elected
as
an
mp
so
tony
blair
michael
howard
and
myself
were
all
class
of
thisisanumber
and
over
that
nearly
quarter
of
a
century
the
world
has
changed
out
of
recognition
he
any
longer
lib
dems
good
people
reasonable
ideas
but
only
if
we
thought
they
could
win
around
here
its
a
wasted
evidence
of
peoples
senses
demonstrates
that
it
isnt
a
wasted
vote
but
he
said
mr
blair
had
lost
the
trust
of
the
british
trust
in
tony
blair
as
prime
minister
and
in
his
government
he
a
party
what
ive
got
to
do
as
a
leader
of
this
party
is
to
convey
to
people
that
what
you
see
is
what
you
get
mr
kennedy
also
used
his
tv
appearance
to
defend
his
partys
plans
to
increase
income
tax
to
thisisanumber
for
those
earning
more
than
thisisanumber
saying
it
would
apply
to
just
thisisanumber
of

allow
his

to
get
rid

said
the
weakness

it

better
that

mr

they

said
there
was
still
very
deep
disquiet
about
the

among

the

was
intensely
authoritarian

was
creating
increasingly
a

be
a
costly

kennedy
repeated
his
call
for
a
pause
in
considering
the
programme
that
mr
clarke
had
a
real
opportunity
on
monday
following
the
departure
of
mr

a
business
would
you
have
the
second
reading
of
the

cards
bill
tomorrow
or
would
you
pause
to
reflect
and
see
what
you
might
do
about
it
in
the
new
year
that
is
the
sensible
way
to
go
about
it
but
i
think
this
government
has
got
itself
so
much
into
tram
lines
now
that
it
is
not
behaving
sensibly
at
all
the
first
cards
would
be
issued
in
thisisanumber
and
when
he
was
introducing
the
bill
mr
blunkett
suggested
parliament
could
decide
in
thisisanumber
or
thisisanumber
whether
to
make
it
compulsory
for
everybody
to
own
the
cards
although
not
to
carry
new

he
had
been
shocked
by

had
shown
it
to

were
similarly
distasteful
for
a

to

these

this

clearly
overstepped

i
wouldnt
for

if
he
his

i
believe
it
is

will
come
to
the
point
where
he
says

that
i
have
caused

scotland
has
thursday
when
projected
increases
will
be
more
than
twice
the
rate
of
inflation
which
is
currently
to
limit
increases
but
they
have
warned
that
they
will
struggle
to
maintain
services
unless
funding
is
is
for
new
said
last
week
in
parliament
i
announced
an
additional
thisisanumber
for
core
expenditure
to
local
government
in
against
an
inflation
rate
of
thisisanumber
so
i
think
we
have
quite
rightly
said
to
councils
this
year
that
we
would
at
the
very
least
ask
them
to
exercise
restraint
mr
mccabe
is
also
looking
for
local
authorities
to
become
more
efficient
and
save
money
in
coming
live
programme
here
in
scotland
we
have
thisisanumber
councils
who
all
have
their
own
individual
collection
systems
for
council
tax
they
have
their
own
payroll
systems
and
their
own
human
resource
opportunities
there
for
rationalisation
and
using
the
money
saved
to
reinvest
in
frontline
services
the
councils
umbrella
organisation
cosla
which
provided
bbc
scotland
with
the
indicative
figures
for
next
year
warned
that
councils
would
face
a
continuous
struggle
to
maintain
thisisanumber
next
targeted
to
new
initiatives
and
councils
will
experience
difficulties
in
maintaining
core
services
a
cosla
spokesman
to
work
with
the
executive
on
finding
efficiency
savings
but
that
these
will
not
be
enough
to
maintain
the
next
three
years
will
see
councils
lose
more
of
the
share
of
public
of
using
the
council
tax
to
raise
funds
because
it
is
too
afraid
to
raise
income
msp
said
its
a
form
of
tax
is
being
used
as
a
way
of
passing
on
pence
income
tax
that
it
could
put
up
what
weve
seen
over
the
years
is
more
and
more
burdens
being
put
onto
local
authorities
and
the
council
tax
payer
having
to
pick
up
the
bill
there
are
also
warnings
that
unless
funding
to
councils
is
increased
in
the
next
few
years
then
services
may
have
to
be
local
authority
management
centre
at
strathclyde
university
said
with
this
current
settlement
the
increase
is
on
councils
are
greater
than
they
increases
and
the
executive
is
also
requiring
a
substantial
figure
in
the
area
of
thisisanumber
in
efficiency
savings
across
the
settlement
period
education
will
be
protected
from
any
cuts
but
linda
knox
says
this
will
mean
other
services
will
mean
a
thisisanumber
cut
for
other
settlement
looks
like
an
increase
of
about
thisisanumber
but
by
the
time
you
take
into
account
other
factors
its
probably
only
about
thisisanumber
in
real
the
shredding
of
official
documents
figures
compiled
by
the
tories
number
of
documents
being
shredded
ahead
of
the

on
thisisanumber
which
had
all
increased
file
destruction
said
they
were
following
rules
governing
public
commissioner
to
for
the
first
time
give
members
of
the
public
access
to
government
records
previously
kept
secret
for
thisisanumber
said
the
prospect
of
outsiders
poking
their
noses
into
the
inner
workings
of
whitehall
appeared
to
be
causing
jitters
among
the
the
select
committee
which
monitors
the
department
of
constitutional
affairs
said
if
the
claims
were
true
whitehall
was
acting
entirely
against
the
spirit
of
the
new
select
committee
will
have
to
keep
this
issue
under
very
close
scrutiny
fellow
lib
dem
norman
baker
said
the
episode
painted
an
unflattering
picture
of
the
inner
workings
of
initial
enthusiasm
for
open
government
has
turned
to
selfserving
cynicism
dr
julian
lewis
the
conservative
spokesman
for
the
cabinet
office
said
he
had
discovered
a
huge
acceleration
in
shredding
from
a
series
of
parliamentary
destroyed
nearly
thisisanumber
files
last
year
up
thisisanumber
on
four
years
ago
when
the
act
was

ministry
of
defence
and
the
departments
of
environment
food
and
rural

and

and

the
most
senior

figures
will
discuss
plans
for
restructuring

on

to
five
and
merging
these
into
a
super
from
campaigners
and
politicians
by
defence
secretary
geoff
hoon
and
prime
minister
tony
be
made
public
next
the
army
it
drew
a
question
mark
over
the
futures
of
the
black
watch
the
kings
own
scottish
borderers
the
royal
scots
the
royal
highland
fusiliers
and
the
argyll
and
sutherland
colonels
proposed
the
merger
of
the
royal
scots
and
the
kings

scottish
borderers
into
a
single
one
of
five
in
the
new
super
amalgamate
the
six
regiments
into
a
super
regiment
sparked
a
political
outcry
with
labour
backbenchers
and
opposition
politicians
opposing
the
because
the
black
watch
was
in
the
frontline
in
iraq
suffering
were
so
angered
they
threatened
to
stand
against
labour
at
the
next
general
board
meeting
a
spokesman
said
the
government
and
the
army
board
have
spent
the
past
four
months
attempting
to
trick
serving
soldiers
and
the
public
into
thinking
their
planned
changes
for
the
scottish
regiments
are
for
the
good
of
the
army
and
for
that
of
the
serving
the
good
and
will
destroy
scotlands
regiments
by
moulding
them
into
a
single
super
regiment
which
will
lead
to
severe
recruitment
problems
a
loss
of
local
connections
to
those
regiments
and
a
loss
to
scotland
of
an
important
part
of
her
heritage
and
most
importantly
her
future
the
regiments
are
the
envy
of
armies
around
the
world
an
alternative
blueprint
had
been
put
forward
by
labour
mp
eric
joyce
who
proposed
going
ahead
with
the
merger
while
preserving
the
other
speculation
the
prime
minister
might
consider
the
plan
but
that
now
seems
blair
said
the
aim
was
to
preserve
tradition
but
introduce
a
more
effective
structure
and
hinted
that
a
super
regiment
was
get
rid
of
the
history
or
the
traditions
of
the
regiment
or
the
local
connections
far
from
it
all
they
want
to
do
is
make
sure
they
can
transfer
people
easily
across
regiments
and
deploy
them
more
flexibly
the
prime
minister
said
he
hoped
campaigners
concerns
would
be
taken
into
account
but
the
need
for
effective
change
had
to
be
times
more
likely
to
go
to
university
than
those
from
the
most
deprived
areas
a
report
england
said
more
people
went
to
university
between
thisisanumber
and
hardly
changed
at
all
said
its
chief
executive
sir
howard
to
university
while
tuition
fees
and
student
loans
made
no
major
benefits
data
said
teenagers
in
the
richest
areas
could
expect
a
better
than
thisisanumber
chance
of
going
to
university
while
in
the
poorest
neighbourhoods
it
was
thisisanumber
in
kensington
and
chelsea
thisisanumber
in
the
city
of
london
and
westminster
and
thisisanumber
in
sheffield
hallam
down
to
thisisanumber
in
bristol
south
and
leeds
central
and
thisisanumber
in
nottingham
north
and
sheffield
the
entrenched
divisions
between
rich
and
poor
areas
but
added
it
was
a
social
as
much
as
an
educational
once
children
from
deprived
backgrounds
get
into
university
they
do
very
postgraduate
study
than
those
from
more
affluent
of
raising
aspirations
amongst
those
families
and
those
communities
that
university
is
something
for
them
and
not
for
other
peoplehe
said
by
the
time
universities
traditionally
dealt
with
pupils
between
the
ages
of
thisisanumber
and
thisisanumber
it
was
too
to
communities
and
schools
much
earlier
even
down
to
primary
school
level
to
persuade
them
a
university
education
was
something
they
could
aspire
to
he
inequalities
and
exposed
the
extent
of
the
challenge
there
were
some
encouraging
findings
he
england
and
wales
and
the
different
fee
regime
in
scotland
did
not
seem
to
have
affected
the
choices
of
young
people
even
the
thisisanumber
more
likely
than
men
to
enter
higher
education
in
thisisanumber
up
from
thisisanumber
in
was
thisisanumber
in
womens
favour
and
growing
faster
than
anywhere
said
we
are
working
in
schools
to
raise
the
attainment
and
aspiration
of
young
people
in
disadvantaged
areas
higher
standards
in
schools
would
lead
to
greater
participation
in
higher
england
would
be
removed
with
grants
for
the
less
well
said
it
is
clear
from
this
report
that
children
from
disadvantaged
areas
are
far
more
likely
to
have
encountered
poor
standards
in
their
secondary
priority
for
any
government
looking
to
improve
university
access
the
group
which
represents
university
vicechancellors
universities
uk
said
the
new
system
of
deferred
fees
in
england
due
to
start
in
thisisanumber
with
grants
and
bursaries
for
poorer
students
would
encourage
more
of
them
to
go
into
higher
the
opposite
that
the
situation
was
likely
to
get
much
worse
with
poorer
students
being
restricted
in
choice
and
having
to
make
decisions
based
on
their
financial
situation
rather
than
rate

many

plainspeaking
and
straight

is
something
which
matters
so
much
to
me
as
a

as
a
man
that
i
have
decided
of
my
own

to
request
an
independent
review
of
the
allegations
that
i
misused
my
positioni
dont
think
anyone
can
say
i
have
said
one
thing
in

done
another
in

it
would
be
dangerous
territory
if
i
wasnt

what
i
preach
which
is
to
always
accept
responsibility
always
accept
the
consequences
of
your

about
party
politicsi
accepted
by
necessity
we
have
to
have
prevention
under
a
new
category
which
is
to
intervene
before
the
act
is
committed
rather
than
do
so
by
due
process
after
the
act
is
committed
when
its
too
late
he
said
in

to
new
antiterrorism
been
hugely
successful
said
mr

dover
has
dropped
dramatically
strengthening
our
identity
is
one
way
or
reinforcing
peoples
confidence
and
sense
of
citizenship
and
wellbeing
i
foolishly
thought
as
this
was
a
celebrity
edition
it
would
be
more
relaxed
than
normal
you
wake
up
and
you
receive
a
phone
call
shipmans
topped
for
a
minute
is
it
too
early
to
open
a
not
take
part
in
a
tv
debate
with
his
political
rivals
ahead
of
the
next
and
for
the
reasons
i
have
given
before
the
answer
is
no
he
said
at
his
monthly
news
said
mr
blair
would
be
running
scared
if
he
refused
calls
to
go
the
opposition
has
always
called
for
a
debate
although
it
has
never
a
debate
between
mr
blair
william
hague
and
charles
kennedy
blair
and
john
major
was
also
cancelled
when
a
format
could
not
be
point
of
the
us
presidential
election
chance
most
pressure
groups
get
to
make
a
real
impact
on
government
plan
to
make
sure
their
cause
is
being
debated
ahead
of
an
expected
spring
to
be
increased
from
thisisanumber
to
the
pensioner
credit
guarantee
level
of
current
pensioners
below
the
poverty
line
weve
got
to
make
it
more
generous
or
have
these
people
living
in
of
the
candidates
in
the
thisisanumber
the
top
five
issues
including
the
pension
issue
they
would
will
publish
the
results
within
the
constituencies
and
nationally
as
politicians
on
the
fact
that
there
are
thisisanumber
voters
over
thisisanumber
in
the
country
they
are
more
likely
to
vote
than
other
sections
of
society
and
thirdly
they
are
true
swing
will
vote
for
a
labour
government
this
time
big
election
issue
even
though
the
government
has
postponed
the
publication
of
adair
turners
full
report
into
the
of
the
least
generous
pensions
systems
in
the
developed
impact
of
aviation
on
the
but
i
imagine
we
will
lobby
political
parties
and
incumbent
in
their
particular
areas
and
we
will
provide
a
national
planned
but
they
cant
be
ruled
we
will
be
the
public
consciousness
to
an
extent
but
it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
an
election
will
raise
its
importance
in
the
public
mind
or
whether
it
will
be
pushed
out
by
big
issues
like
the
parliament
act
thisisanumber
in
a
high
court
the
new
other
side
will
appeal
so
we
expect
it
to
fall
plumb
in
electioneering
on
thisisanumber
february
we
will
be
going
to
the
european
court
because
no
compensation
is
being
territory
to
the
ministers
by
demonstrating
and
try
to
turn
up
and
speak
to
whoever
it
avoided
us
and
cancelled
engagements
so
that
makes
it
whole
it
is
groups
of
angry
of
shouting
because
people
are
angry
but
there
is
no
violence
because
that
does
not
achieve
run
up
to
the
most
important
general
election
tony
blair
will
ever
did
not
table
until
after
the
for
sport
both
here
and
because
of
trophy
of
shooting
for
its
a
tiger
or
a
in
relation
to
trophy
of
the
target
animal
industry
the
from
individual
mps
and
wouldbe
mps
saying
that
they
are
against
the
use
of
animals
as
targets
for
political
parties
but
i
think
a
general
election
is
very
much
to
do
with
pledges
mps
make
to
their
who
were
happy
to
say
they
were
against
is
a
very
real
climbing
up
the
a
ban
i
am
not
suffering
and
in
time
that
will
lead
to
a
the
most
important
for
this
election
is
commonplace
in
government
and
across
the
political
to
be
the
privatisation
of
this
but
whats
really
missing
from
the
debate
is
the
consumers
choice
in
if
all
you
have
to
choose
from
is
two
failing
misselling
scandals
and
in
the
pensions
industry
theres
a
maximum
of
choice
but
a
minimum
quality
in
terms
that
means
clear
and
accessible
information
to
operate
that
every
communicate
with
what
we
will
be
doing
is
holding
a
preelection
mps
journalists
and
up
communications
between
members
of
the
public
and
the
used
by
the
main
political
sensitive
to
this
issue
they
want
to
be
seen
to
be
responding
to
this
of
operational
costs
for
road
haulage
proposed
increase
of
thisisanumber
per
litre
that
gordon
brown
has
been
postponing
and
great
deal
but
every
year
if
you
operate
one
vehicle
thats
an
increase
of
about
obviously
thisisanumber
times
will
be
absolutely
throughout
the
industry
and
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
you
see
widespread
will
be
a
number
of
firms
going
out
of
we
have
always
done
we
keep
the
issue
in
the
trade
that
it
is
getting
harder
to
get
into
the
national
like
lorries
they
see
us
as
a
complaining
you
see
a
car
on
the
road
it
is
probably
going
to
work
when
you
see
a
lorry
its
already
at
and
gordon
brown
are
said
to
have
declared
all
out
war
on
each
over
who
should
take
the
credit
for
the
governments
global
aid
and
debt
initiatives
particularly
in
the
wake
of
the
tsunami
disaster
an
issue
many
hoped
and
believed
was
above
such
news
conference
which
saw
mr
blair
start
in
full
irritation
mode
as
he
was
forced
to
bat
away
question
after
question
about
his
relationship
with
his
not
interested
in
what
goes
in
and
out
of
purpose
and
he
again
heaped
praise
on
mr
brown
saying
he
was
doing
a
great
job
and
would
continue
doing
it
although
he
would
not
commit
to
any
job
for
mr
brown
after
the
press
conference
at
the
last
moment
so
it
coincided
with
mr
browns
longarranged
keynote
speech
on
aid
and
debt
he
was
asked
by
now
mr
blair
had
moved
from
irritation
mode
to
his
barely
disguised
fury
knew
very
well
what
the
operational
reasons
were
for
the
timing
of
his
press
man
gordon
was
and
how
united
they
were
before
again
sneering
that
he
took
absolutely
no
notice
of
what
went
in
and
out
of
the
newspapers
preferring
to
get
on
with
the
job
of
doing
the
best
for
the
country
and
the
declared
i
get
increasingly
alarmed
by
what
i
read
in
the
newspapers
before
catching
himself
on
and
quickly
adding
in
so
far
as
i
read
them
of
course
he
probably
had
good
reason
to
be
alarmed
because
the
newspapers
had
been
full
of
stories
about
the
claimed
open
warfare
between
the

press
conference
is

there
are
two
a
calculated
attempt
to
upstage
the

and
seize
back
the
initiative
on
the
big
issue
of
the
suggests
that
even
the
fear
of
seriously
negative
newspaper
headlines
is
not
enough
to
stop
the
was
an
unavoidable
coincidence
which
would
suggest
the
government
has
lost
its
oncefamed
ability
to
strictly
coordinate
announcements
through
the
infamous
downing
street
grid
to
avert
just
such
same
to
overshadow
the
big
announcements
of
government
policy
on
a
hugely
pertinent
that
the
new

had
started
with
a
fresh
outbreak
of
the

appeared
to
have
taken
the

over

to
the

while
mr

was
still
on

in

he
had
been
excluded
from
a
prominent

in
general

had
as

mr

he
will
not

gossip
distract
him
from
helping
a

are
behaving
like
squabbling
schoolboys
and
the
liberal
democrats
claim
personal
ambition
is
obstructing
good
to
stiffen
the
spines
of

mps
it
is
the
prospect
of
losing
their

at
a

that
led

being
read
the
riot
act
during
a
meeting
of
the
parliamentary
labour
and
labour
peers
over
the
claimed
squabbling
between
the
two
men
starkly
demonstrated
the
widelyheld
view
within
the
labour
party
that
the
two
most
powerful
figures
in
the
government
are
jeopardising
the
next
the
meeting
it
is
time
they
realised
its
not
just
my
seat
they
are
threatening
but
if
they
go
on
like
this
they
could
put
the
election
in
doubt
it
is
a
sentiment
that
is
now
running
throughout
the
labour
benches
with
mps
eager
to
underline
the
message
to
their
leaders
to
stop
the
squabbling
and
get
on
with
the
job
at
deeply
upset
the
party
is
in
this
time
of
all
times
when
we
wanted
to
come
together
we
wanted
to
lead
on
the
global
issues
to
change
politics
for
the
next
decade
the
whole
thing
was
wrecked
by
a
piece
of
childishness
by
the
two
main
people
in
the
party
two
people
we
greatly
respectstephen
pound
echoed
the
message
saying
we
know
that
the
one
thing
that
could
entirely
jeopardise
what
we
are
trying
to
achieve
not
for
the
labour
party
but
for
this
country
is
the
appearance
of
the
squabbling
stopped
the
people
briefing
on
behalf
of
the
two
men
would
be
named
and
done
the
trick
with
mr
brown
joining
his
alleged
rival
alan
milburn
who
the
prime
minister
put
in
charge
of
election
planning
in
mr
browns
stead
and
deputy
prime
minister
john
prescott
at
an

is
to
have
achieved
two
any
more
that
the
stories
of
the
rift
between
the
chancellor
and
the
prime
minister
are
fictions
created
by
the
media
and
he
still
been
a
backbencher
he
would
have
been
giving
mr
blair
and
mr
brown
the
same
view
that
the
election
campaign
has
to
all
intents
and
purposes
kicked
the
subsequent
change
in
behaviour
by
the
two
men
will
do
any
good
or
can
even
be
sustained
through
the
campaign
remains
to
be
their
fears
it
emerged
that
while
mr
brown
is
in
africa
for
a
week
the
prime
minister
is
to
deliver
a
keynote
speech
on
election
themes
for
a
third
his
recent
insistence
that
the
next
manifesto
will
be
new
labour
through
and
the
chancellor
during
the
election
poster
launch
once
again
refused
to
deny
the
claim
that
he
told
the
prime
minister
he
could
never
trust
anything
he
now
is
that
the
effect
of
the
warnings
from
the
backbenchers
will
actually
be
to
silence
the
brown
camp
effectively
strengthening
the
prime

their

tory
leader

has
claimed
in
a
heated

fight
crime
when
they
are
fighting
each

that
question
was
later
unveiled
as
the
headline
for
new

campaign
of

said
peoples
priorities
at
the
next
elections
would
be
on
the
economic
successes
achieved
by
likes
on
billboards
about
something
in
a

but
what
the
public
will
concentrate
on
are
the
low
mortgages
low
inflation
low
unemployment
that
we
delivered
and
that
he
failed
to
he
highprofile
tour
of
africa
to
highlight

he
still
trusted
mr

despite
claims
to
the
contrary
in

would
stand
down

before
the

after
support
from

allies
and
suspicion
that
mr

was
manoeuvring
against
him
it
brown
told
mr
blair
there
is
nothing
you
could
ever
say
to
me
now
that
i
could
ever
believe
mr
blair
directly
denied
that
quote
on
no
deals
about
the
premiership
but
twice
declined
directly
to
say
whether
or
not
he
had
offered
to
agreements
had
been
struck
twice
at
dinners
with
the

prime
a
happy

he
continued
how
can
there
be
discipline
in

when
there
is
no
discipline
in
government
how
can
they
clean
up
our
hospitals
when
they
dont
clean
up
their
act
mr
blair
said
he
would
not
respond
to
tittle
tattle
in
books
and
promised
to
hail

until

cochairman

his

would
exploit
opportunities
to
show
how
juvenile
the

and
chancellor
at
its
own
poster
launch
on
tuesday
where
mr
brown
was
joined
by
alan
milburn
who
mr
blair
controversially
put
in
charge
of
election
planning
in
place
of
the
told
bbc
news
the
government
is
clearly
split
at
the
not

anybody
later
this
week
mr
blair
is
expected
to
outline
the
direction
of
his
partys
next
election
backbench
discontent
at
mondays
meeting
of
the
parliamentary
labour
party
over
claims
made
mr
pestons
blair
and
brown
are
like
squabbling
school
kids
and
that
they
and
their
supporters
need
to
grow
up
and
stop
it
adults
do
even
a
trivial
argument
between
mature
protagonists
can
be
hard
to
stop
once
its
got
feud
is
that
everyone
can
agree
theyd
be
better
off
if
it
ended
but
everyone
wants
to
have
the
last
to
stop
but
thinks
it
worth
prolonging
the
argument
just
a
tiny
bit
to
ensure
their
view
is
argument
with
their
last
word
ensure
the
argument
goes
on
and
on
and
and
mr
brown
successive
books
are
published
ensuring
the
issues
never
die
now
this
isnt
because
the
participants
are
stupid
its
actually
each
individual
behaving
entirely
rationally
given
the
incentives
facing
economic
theory
that
explains
all
growth
theory
which
the
chancellor
himself
once
quoted
but
a
ubiquitous
piece
of
game
theory
which
all
respectable
policy
wonks
are
familiar
prisoners
dilemma
based
on
a
parable
much
told
in
economics
degree
are
jointly
charged
with
a
heinous
crime
and
are
locked
up
in
separate
confession
from
at
least
one
of
them
to
provide
enough
evidence
to
convict
them
of
the
get
a
minimal
sentence
on
some
trumped
up
to
keep
their
mouths
shut
and
take
the
short
sentence
but
the
clever
sheriff
has
an
idea
to
induce
them
to
if
they
confess
and
they
are
the
only
one
to
confess
theyll
be
let
off
their
they
dont
confess
and
they
are
the
only
one
not
to
confess
theyll
get
with
this
choice
your
best
bet
is
to
get
off
youd
better
confess
to
ensure
you
dont
get
prisoners
confess
so
the
sheriff
does
not
have
to
let
either
one
behave
that
way
even
though
both
would
have
been
better
if
they
had
somehow
agreed
to
shut
follow
it
you
can
to
look
it
up
on
google
where
there
are
thisisanumber
entries
on
ramifications
have
truly
captured
economists
in
the
last
couple
of
describe
any
situation
where
there
is
an
obvious
sensible
choice
to
be
taken
collectively
but
where
the
only
rational
choice
individually
is
to
behave
example
a
classic
case
where
both
russia
and
america
would
be
better
off
with
just
a
few
arms
rather
than
a
lot
of
just
a
few
more
arms
than
the
other
an
arms
race
ensues
with
the
results
that
the
individually
logical
decision
to
buy
more
arms
results
in
arms
levels
that
are
too
once
youre
in
a
prisoners
dilemma
unless
you
are
repeating
the
experience
many
times
over
its
hard
to
escape
the
perverse
logic
of
to
stop
buying
arms
or
to
stop
arguing
when
all
their
incentives
encourage
them
to
carry
party
if
you
believe
the
rift
between
blair
and
brown
camps
is
as
bad
as
the
reports
suggest
solomons
wisdom
needs
to
be
deployed
to
solve
the
solutions
to
arguments
solutions
which
affect
the
incentives
of
the
that
one
divides
the
other
chooses
as
a
way
of
allocating
a
piece
of
cake
to
be
sliced
up
between
greedy
endless
argument
if
you
want
it
to
come
to
an
end
you
have
to
ensure
the
person
who
has
the
last
word
is
one
who
loses
rather
than
the
one
who
wins
the
by
even
one
more
briefing
or
one
more
book
for
that
matter
has
to
exceed
the
benefit
of
having
the
last
word
and
getting
your
point
can
enforce
that
theyll
have
the
protagonists
retreating
pretty
looked
back
on
as
the
performance
that
kicked
off
the
election
thisisanumber
weeks
away
but
there
can
be
little
doubt
left
that
the
campaign
is
now
in
full
to
a
selected
audience
in
the
south
east
to
set
out
his
broad
brush
election
the

record
with
a
major
emphasis
on
the
economy
and
public
the
line
under
the
gossip
surrounding
his
rift
with
chancellor
gordon
the
importance
of
the
party
continuing
to
operate
as
unremittingly
new
labour
although
that
may
continue
to
irritate
his
concrete
proposals
or
what
might
form
manifesto
pledges
although
the
prime
minister
talked
about
a
new
labour
manifesto
that
will
be
aimed
at
all
sections
of
to
remind
people
and
some
in
his
own
party
precisely
what
new
labour
stood
for
and
to
leave
them
in
no
doubt
there
would
not
be
any
shrinking
away
from
that
that
new
labour
actually
does
stand
for
something
that
it
is
as
he
said
more
than
an
electoral
a
broad
programme
aimed
to
appeal
to
both
middle
england
voters
who
switched
to
the
party
in
thisisanumber
and
stuck
with
it
possibly
through
some
gritted
teeth
in
thisisanumber
and
to
more
traditional

in
our
third

and
again
insisted
the
future

would
be

but
he
also
heaped
praise
on
him
as
the
most
successful
postwar
chancellor
britain
has
the
two
men
in
so
far
as
there
is
one
is
about
the
degree
of
private
finance
allowed
into
the
public
the
prime
minister
is
happy
to
make
plain
will
stress
the
importance
of
that
the
belief
patients
and
parents
for
example
want
a
choice
of
good
services
before
they
start
worrying
about
who
has
provided

more
sceptical
about
private
finance
although
there
is
no
suggestion
he
opposes
it
in
big
speech
from
gordon

will
be
closely
examined
for
any
signs
of
divisions
and
in
particular
the
use
of
that
little

only
succeeded
in

by
the
conservatives
as

of
their
effort
to
show
how
government
red
tape
can
be
scrapped
under
proposals
which
the
tories
say
would
save
more
than

the
new

a
slimmer

lower

be
and
other
regional
bodies
such
as
boards
tackling
industrial

and
elected
local

or
national
authorities
are
not

as
it
is
better
that
local
people
rather
than
officials
run
hospitals
and
mr

has
forgotten
the
interests
of
taxpayers
and
has
broken
the
pledges

has
led

to

that

inherently
tory

he
also
appears
to
believe

cant
possibly
renegotiate
anything
as
michael

is
pledged
to
store

saying
before
i
can

with

i

i

another
great

seeks
political

to
move
the
entire

of

making
away
from

and
we
oppose
that
and
the

cannot
be
trusted
to
oppose
the
tories
as
former

robert
kilroysilk
once
notoriously
declared
withdraw
from
the
eu
and
if
it
has
any
relation
to
the
tories
it
is
to
stiffen
the
tories
spine
on
the
issue
by
having
a
large
enough
ukip
vote
so
that
we
move
the
tories
in
the
direction
they
are
refusing
to
the
amount
to
do
with
tony
blairs
decision
to
hold
a
referendum
on
the
european
constitution
and
i
think
it
had
a
huge
amount
to
do
with
his
refusal
to
go
into
the
subject
of
mr
kilroysilk
mr
morris
despatches
him
with
another
of
his
neat
team
player
it
is
a
good
idea
our
party
stands
for
some
thing
and
not
some
for
the
general
look
we
are
not
going
to
be
forming
the
next
government
he
every
election
he
says
the
outcome
will
be
decided
by
a
small
number
of
swing
seats
just
as
he
believes
it
will
in
is
to
target
those
seats
and
end
the
day
with
a
significant
group
in
the
the
internet
could
have
a
big
part
in
the
in

election

posting
their

general
the
the
consensus
so
tightly
and
to
the
left
there
is
room
for
another

holding
the
balance
of
that
the

may
indeed
produce
some
surprises
even
while
most
still
believe
it
is
labours
for
the

was
just
such
a
shocker
and
showed
that
mr

point
about

topped

from

breakfast
with

letwin
have
been
edging
towards
an

on
this

for
some
months
now
but
without
any
concrete
the
thisisanumber
he
has
earmarked
from

thisisanumber
will
be
used
to
plug

claimed
financial
black

with
any
left
over
going

in
mr

first
there
are
already
suggestions
he
is
set
to
announce
lifting
the

on

and
reforming

abolishing

time
say
there
would
be
such

a
clear
choice
between
mr

who
will

more

which
will

open
that
famed
clear

between

and

return
to
a

that
will
both
reassure
the

appeal
to

over
to

his

the

robert

he
the

the

will
also
play
a

will
probably
be
the
greatest
influence
over
the
way
people
finally
have
been
crying
out
for
mr
howard
to
get
back
onto
the
old
tory
tax
cuts
that
as
a
result
he
would
slash
public
services
so
he
has
attempted
to
shoot
that
fox
any
government
cash
surpluses
were
spent
on
schools
and
hospitals
before

he
has
suggested
that
is
exactly
what
he
will
to
shift
those

remains
to

can
save
thisisanumber
in

spending
by
tackling
into
frontline
services
like
the

with
the

used
to
cut

and
reduce
off
the
defection
of
one
of
his
mps
robert

it
would

mr

some
of
the

you

another

you
are
going

mr

is
out
of

that
is

is
expected
to

that
around

that
will
give

less
however
chief
treasury
secretary
paul
boateng
said
none
of
the
tories
figures
add
up
so
they
cant
make
these
savings
and
cant
pay
for
any
tax
cuts
which
means
the
only
guaranteed
cut
from
the

is
thisisanumber

not
the

who
are

the

to
off

the

charles

dismissed
the

as
a
fading
limit
to
his

ambitions
in
the
coming
impressive
recent
election
results
to
back
up
his
optimism
for
an
election
which
he
believes
might
just
see
his
party
doing
big
cautious
about
making
any
predictions
about
how
they
will
do
come
the
big
into
that
trap
when
he
fired
up
his
campaign
from
the
partys
westminster
than
that
he
expected
the
lib
dems
to
increase
both
their
votes
and
their
commons
seats
at
the
tories
was
now
so
narrow
as
proved
he
claimed
by
the
defection
to
labour
of
robert
jackson
that
only
his
party
offered
a
genuine
cards
student
fees
and
the
council
tax
there
was
nothing
to
chose
between
the
two
big
parties
whereas
the
liberal
democrats
offered
costed
sensible
the
two
party
consensus
on
taxation
by
promising
to
increase
income
tax
on
those
earning
more
than
thisisanumber
a
year
to
pay
for
the
scrapping
of
student
fees
the
introduction
of
free
personal
care
for
the
elderly
and
replacing
the
council
tax
with
a
local
income
a
pledge
that
he
would
be
doing
no
deals
to
prop
up
either
of
the
other
big
parties
after
the
optimistic
sounds
coming
from
the
third
party
could
be
dismissed
as
with
the
liberal
that
the
lib
dems
are
no
hopers
whose
greatest
effect
on
the
poll
will
be
to
boost
the
hopes
of
their
opponents
by
denying
them
otherwise
winnable
supporters
may
switch
to
the
lib
dems
allowing
the
tories
to
win
some
for
a
more
significant
outcome
than
big
breakthrough
although
there
are
those
who
believe
this
could
well
be
the
election
that
sees
his
party
crossing
some
sort
of
symbolic
time
of
the
election
after
next
the
liberal
democrats
may
genuinely
have
replaced
the
tories
as
the
party

of

will
also
offer
sensible
costed
and
achievable
policies
on
things
like
the
council
tax
crime
and
asylum
that
will
underpin
his
claim
that
his
party
really
is
the
only
opposition
worth

said
human

had
been
flouted
in
the

thisisanumber
september
had
to
use
simpler

both
to
prevent

spread
a
moral
not

on

for
including
those
at

at

the

evidence

human

ms

the
single
most
powerful

she
failed

mobilise
public

about

consensual
approach
to
world
politics
as
he
begins
his
second
term
as
us
president
tony
blair
has
had
learned
military
force
was
not
the
only
way
to
fight
of
peaceful
coexistence
lies
in
the
spread
of
democracy
and
human
rights
mr
blair
told
the
guardian
a
ceremony
in
washington
dc
on
state
condoleezza
rice
the
prime
minister
said
there
has
been
a
clear
evolution
of
us
policy
since
the
war
in
afghanistan
in
change
over
time
in
conversations
with
mr
and
security
measures
were
important
there
also
needed
to
be
a
multilateral
approach
to
solving
the
worlds
us
was
poised
for
further
military
action
mr
blair
refused
to
give
succour
to
suggestions
it
was
preparing
for
strikes
against
us
had
what
appears
to
be
a
harder
position
towards
the
state
than
that
until
now
the
us
had
allowed
britain
france
and
germany
to
take
the
lead
in
trying
to
halt
the
iranian
nuclear
worked
inside
iran
to
identify
potential
targets
mr
blair
was
asked
if
the
sas
had
also
been
in
the
forces
but
do
not
take
that
as
indicating
an
affirmative
said
mr
president
was
keen
to
work
with
other
countries
while
trying
to
spread
democracy
and
human
that
he
is
coming
to
europe
as
his
first
foreign
visit
said
mr
due
in
europe
at
the
end
of
quit
the
uk
independence
party
and
accused
it
of
betraying
its
to
have
joined
the
party
which
he
labelled
as
a
next
general
election
but
refused
to
confirm
he
is
setting
up
a
new
political
party
called
veritas
latin
for
would
break
open
the
champagne
adding
it
was
nice
knowing
him
now
goodbye
however
he
did
say
the
exchat
show
host
had
been
quite
useful
people
but
sadly
after
the
european
election
it
became
clear
that
he
was
more
interested
in
the
robert
kilroysilk
party
than
the
uk
independence
party
so
it
was
nice
knowing
him
now
goodbye
mr
knapman
told
bbc
radio
thisisanumber
today
kilroysilk
posed
a
threat
to
ukip
and
queried
why
he
had
failed
to
confirm
rumours
he
was
starting
a
new
political
his
east
midlands
constituents
at
a
meeting
in
hinckley
began
a
process
which
could
have
triggered
mr
kilroysilks
membership
of
ukip
after
just
nine
publicity
which
helped
ukip
into
third
place
in
last
junes
european
elections
but
became
dominated
by
rancour
as
he
tried
to
take
over
the
party
meps
of
being
content
with
growing
fat
sitting
on
their
backsides
in
tried
to
change
the
party
i
nagged
all
the
way
through
the
summer
to
do
things
to
get
moving
because
i
thought
it
was
criminal
what
they
were
doing
it
was
a
betrayal
mr
kilroysilk
also
told
sky
news
there
was
masses
of
support
for
him
to
form
a
new
party
something
he
has
yet
to
confirm
will
of
the
vote
at
the
european
elections
on
the
back
of
its
call
for
the
uk
to
leave
the
european
union
in
his
speech
mr
kilroysilk
says
the
result
offered
ukip
an
amazing
opportunity
but
the
partys
leadership
had
done
nothing
and
gone
no
vision
and
no
spokespeople
he
im
embarrassed
with
its
allies
in
europe
and
im
ashamed
to
be
a
member
of
the
party
said
mr
right
to
govern
itself
had
not
ukip
when
he
contested
the
general
election
in
an
east
midlands
have
prompted
a
formal
complaint
to
ukips
disciplinary
committee
for
bringing
the
party
into
kilroysilk
to
stand
down
as
an
mep
so
voters
can
get
a
genuine
ukip
on
conservative
spending
plans
saying
they
are
a
ludicrous
labour
party
gathering
that
the
tory
policies
would
cause
economic
his
party
would
cut
thisisanumber
in
wasteful
spending
to
allow
thisisanumber
in
tax
david
davis
said
the
tories
would
fund
the
cuts
by
removing
inefficiencies
which
had
burgeoned
under
a
reformed
labour
party
which
had
learned
to
occupy
the
political
centre
ground
with
a
hidebound
tory
party
which
he
said
would
turn
the
clock
back
with
spending
and
spending
proposals
would
put
at
risk
both
britains
hardwon
economic
stability
the
lowest
mortgages
inflation
unemployment
for
decades
and
the
key
investment
in
public
are
as
plain
a
call
to
return
to
the
past
as
its
possible
to
imagine
he
same
boom
and
bust
economics
and
cuts
in
public
services
that
were
their
hallmark
in
thisisanumber
years
of
conservative
government
mr
blair
added
they
the
conservatives
have
learned
nothing
by
contrast
he
said
new
labour
had
listened
to
its
electorate
and
his
governments
achievements
and
to
issue
a
rallying
call
to
the
we
can
defend
this
record
and
we
can
build
on
it
and
go
on
and
fulfil
the
promise
or
give
up
and
go
fight
in
response
david
davis
said
the
tories
would
make
cuts
such
as
removing
regional
assemblies
but
would
bring
in
more
police
officers
and
match
labours
spending
on
health
and
government
the
last
seven
years
that
they
faced
lots
of
stealth
tactics
lots
of
increases
in
taxes
but
no
improvement
in
public
services
he
responsible
for
huge
waste
huge
overspending
not
on
the
frontline
at
all
but
on
more
waste
and
more
taxes
with
this
government
less
waste
and
lower
taxes
with
a
tory
government
he
behind
closed
would
see
some
thisisanumber
in
spending
cuts
by
thisisanumber
which
the
tories
party
unity
and
warn
of
the
dangers
of
allowing
themselves
to
be
distracted
or
by
officials
he
told
delegates
we
must
all
show
the
strength
and
unity
of
purpose
to
take
the
longterm
decisions
necessary
to
meet
themmr
brown
warned
that
the
tories
were
planning
the
biggest
cuts
ever
in
the
history
of
any
election
accused
mr
blair
of
misrepresenting
the
partys
proposals
and
questioned
how
labour
would
fund
its
own
truth
which
is
that
we
will
spend
more
on
what
matters
to
people
schools
hospitals
and
police
and
that
we
will
offer
value
for
money
and
lower
taxes
mr
letwin
chancellor
have
failed
to
answer
the
question
that
lies
at
the
heart
of
this
election
which
taxes
will
they
put
up
to
fill
the
thisisanumber
shortfall
in
their
liberal
democrats
will
offer
them
an
honest
choice
at
the
next
general
battling
over
which
will
impose
the
lowest
taxes
mr
kennedy
is
going
into
the
looming
election
pledged
to
increase
certainly
ensures
there
is
that
choice
between
the
lib
dems
and
the
other
increase
taxes
by
one
penny
in
the
pound
to
spend
on
public
services
already
adopted
by
the
government
he
has
switched
a
modest
increase
of
the
same
amount
on
earnings
over
thisisanumber
a
year
to
allow
him
to
finance
a
series
of
finance
free
long
term
care
for
the
elderly
and
replace
the
council
tax
with
a
local
income
about
thisisanumber
of
the
most
well
off
paying
more
while
others
pensioners
in
particular
will
pay
his
policies
as
both
unworkable
and
not
properly
need
to
raise
taxes
to
fund
improvements
in
services
and
cut
taxes
through
thisisanumber
efficiency
savings
while
labour
has
offered
thisisanumber
savings
but
has
yet
to
map
out
precise
tax
proposals
although
there
is
little
chance
they
will
propose
the
lib
dems
and
the
others
over
taxation
and
spending
echo
the
sort
of
arguments
that
raged
between
labour
and
the
tories
in
the
thisisanumber
and
early
he
believes
voters
are
ready
to
see
modest
tax
increases
on
the
well
off
in
order
to
fund
improvements
in
by
recent
polls
suggesting
people
would
rather
have
cash
spent
on
public
services
than
tax
to
the
lib
dem
approach
to
asylum
and
immigration
with
mr
kennedy
stressing
politicians
should
not
foment
an
artificial
debate
about
immigration
and
attacking
michael
howards
proposals
for
big
parties
singing
similar
songs
on
immigration
mr
kennedy
is
stressing
the
different
more
liberal
approach
of
his
mood
over
his
partys
election
chances
declaring
the
tories
were
not
going
to
be
significant
players
in
the
do
postelection
deals
with
either
party
after
the
the
reelection
of
a
labour
government
with
a
small
majority
would
amount
to
a
massive
vote
of
no
confidence
in
tony
blairs
believes
he
may
well
find
himself
in
a
powerful
even
pivotal
position
in
a
vastly
different
house
of
commons
after
the
next
party
has
dreamed
many
times
to
make
any
grand
claims
about
how
his
party
may
fare
at
the
general
commons
he
has
seen
his
fair
share
of
such
claims
dashed
on
the
rocks
of
bitter
experience
and
he
might
say
the
uks
political
and
electoral
the
fact
that
this
is
a
party
and
a
leader
that
believes
it
may
well
be
on
the
way
to
something
special
in
a
few
months
am
not
going
to
put
any
artificial
limits
on
our
ambitions
this
time
around
he
the
most
likely
outcome
is
another
labour
victory
of
some
designed
around
the
notion
of
the
lib
dems
as
the
real
jibe
that
his
is
a
party
actively
bidding
to
come
second
he
is
prepared
to
go
this
far
a
clear
conclusion
has
been
reached
including
by
conservatives
that
the
conservatives
are
not
going
to
win
this
the
liberal
democrat
advance
to
be
one
of
the
big
stories
of
the
election
given
that
we
have
the
capacity
to
take
on
labour
and
win
as
well
as
take
on
the
conservatives
and
the
first
modern
three
party
uk
election
that
we
have
all
with
suggestions
in
the
thisisanumber
that
labour
was
to
labour
still
naturally
gravitate
to
the
conservatives
the
problem
is
that
geographically
the
conservative
party
has
melted
away
in
about
a
third
of
main
alternative
to
labour
in
whole
tracts
of
mainland
an
ageing
and
declining
membership
base
and
they
just
do
not
look
vibrant
or
vital
or
in
touch
any
longer
with
contemporary
dispel
any
impression
his
party
is
the
new
party
of
the
left
and
is
likely
to
attract
mostly
disillusioned
labour
to
be
financed
from
a
thisisanumber
tax
increase
on
those
earning
over
thisisanumber
a
year
will
appeal
right
across
the
political
tax
with
a
local
income
tax
provide
free
long
term
care
for
the
elderly
and
scrap
student
major
party
promising
to
increases
taxes
will
not
land
him
in
the
same
trouble
a
similar
policy
did
to
old
moved
on
a
lot
in
british
politics
particularly
in
the
context
of
the
forthcoming
general
election
he
burden
would
have
to
rise
while
the
tories
plans
to
increase
spending
in
some
areas
while
also
reducing
taxes
is
just
incredible
he
saying
you
know
there
is
likely
to
be
an
increase
in
the
tax
burden
we
are
only
recommending
one
specific
tax
rise
for
the
top
end
of
income
scale
earners
to
fund
three
specific
for
people
one
i
am
very
comfortable
with
and
i
think
will
distinguish
us
from
the
is
its
showing
at
the
election
he
intends
to
go
into
the
next
parliament
on
the
front
foot
with
a
view
to
leading
it
right
through
that
parliament
into
the
next
election
because
i
see
that
as
the
decisive
opportunity
for
gaining
ground
in
westminster
that
if
the
tories
do
as
badly
as
some
fear
the
election
after
next
might
really
see
that
historic
breakthrough
by
the
third
ready
to
put
some
of
the
caution
to
one
he
will
not
stand
for
the
leadership
again
having
given
up
his
ambition
to
be
prime
telegraph
he
would
now
find
a
life
dominated
by
politics
too
boring
and
his
partys
thisisanumber
election
defeat
does
not
rule
out
a
return
to
the
front
hopes
to
remain
mp
for
richmond
north
yorks
and
start
a
family
with
wife
the
biography
of
william
pitt
the
younger
also
said
he
wanted
to
continue
writing
books
and
know
whether
i
will
ever
go
back
on
to
the
front
but
dont
rush
me
asked
if
he
would
stand
for
the
leadership
again
mr
hague
replied
away
from
a
central
role
will
disappoint
some
senior
conservative
members
who
say
the
party
needs
said
last
week
it
would
be
a
huge
boost
to
the
party
if
mr
hague
returned
to
the
front
thisisanumber
and
leader
of
the
opposition
at
by
the
age
of
thisisanumber
i
had
crammed
in
an
entire
political
and
been
leader
of
the
party
so
now
i
can
branch
out
into
other
thingsit
is
a
very
liberating
feeling
mr
hague
added
that
he
may
have
misjudged
his
own
ambition
to
be
prime
politics
as
i
thought
i
was
he
candidate
for
allegedly
suggesting
the
criminally
insane
should
be

in
the

seat
in

who

mr

nothing
of
his
time

after

that
the

that

of

which
they
are
uniquely
able
to
do
mr
croucher
said
the
main
issue
would
be
that
mr
houstons
reported
views
had
been
presented
as
ukip
policy
which
they
were
submissions
to
a
committee
working
on
the

manifesto
but
would
not
have
been
matched
to
mr

when
he
was
standing
to
become
a

have
said
these
member
and
as
a
was
mentioned
at

the
task
in

the
eu

not
individual
idiocies
mr

have
overreacted

overshot

nielson
who
is
ukip
scotland
chairman
said
he
had
suspended
mr

on
friday
matter
is
being
investigated
and
then
we
will
decide
if
and
what
further
action
will
be
taken
he
said
that
any
evidence
would
be
looked
into
and
mr
houston
may
be
interviewed
by
the
much
at
the
moment
i
have
one
version
from
him
but
i
havent
seen
the
papers
of

its

and
that
peers
should
lead
the
way
on
reforming
the

she
believed

the

is
unacceptable
not
that
it
isnt
important
but
the
fact
that
in
general
we
brits
can
be
so
politically
apathetic
some
times
that
we
will
just
let
this
go
without
telling
the
government
the
world
the
common
law
and
a
true
sense
of
the
rights
of
individual
liberty
i
hope
this
will
prove
to
be
one

too
can
say
that
this
country
used
to
be
a
good
place
to

start
a

make

for

and
be
told
what
we
can
or
cannot
we
are
not
allowed
to
have
beliefs
or
spends
too
much
time
meddling
in
us
politics
and
affairs
which
have
little
to
do
with
the
lives
of
british
citizens
at
home
or
job
in
voicing
his
gagged
for
letting
people
express
their
know
and
the
bbcs
role
is
to
inform
educate
and
in
reality
it
is
the
government
which
has
spread
the
fear
by
its
constant
publicising
of
the
this
invisible
enemy
so
dangerous
that
we
must
allow
them
to
ride
roughshod
over
our
rights
and
we
seek
to
protect
is
what
we
are
giving
up
in
the
name
of
safety
from
this
invisible
against
terrorism
but
existing
laws
seem
to
be
more
than
demands
new
powers
is
capability
in
the
uk
is
poison
but
it
is
not
a
weapon
of
mass
enthusiasm
of
mr
blair
and
his
government
for
authoritarian
reactions
and
attempts
to
manipulate
the
electorate
through
with
id
cards
tracking
and
so
on
then
totalitarianism
has
won
and
as
such
it
then
matters
little
whether
we
give
in
to
the
terrorists
demands
or
freedom
which
bush
and
blair
constantly
tells
us
we
have
and
that
they
seek
to
bring
to
with
which
this
government
is
prepared
to
wipe
out
a
major
portion
of
the
liberties
that
british
people
have
enjoyed
for
centuries
the
right
not
to
be
deprived
of
our
liberty
without
a
trial
in
open
carta
and
ordinary
people
have
spilled
their
blood
to
enforce
that
right
against
governments
who
thought
they
knew
you
realise
george
orwell
was
only
wrong
about
one
thing
the
a
police
without
trial
follow
a
pattern
which
includes
the
introduction
of
surveillance
via
compulsory
id
cards
and
the
linking
of
data
bases
together
with
the
unbritish
idea
that
we
will
have
to
swear
allegiance
to
the
state
at
the
age
of
thisisanumber
two
crucial
facts
of
this
new
threat
thisisanumber
if
these
terrorists
acquire
weapons
of
mass
destruction
they
will
use
them
without
fear
of
mutually
assured
destruction
that
kept
the
cold
war
in
a
state
of
tense
against
us
without
fear
of
any
use
suicide
bombers
which
means
they
could
kill
innocent
people
on
the
london
underground
and
we
could
do
very
little
to
stop
deadly
we
have
to
come
up
with
new
tougher
in
the
day
when
people
outside
london
wake
up
one
morning
to
find
out
that
london
has
been
society
left
to
debate
hes
correct
in
most
of
what
he
have
forgotten
that
disgraceful
internment
policy
in
northern
ireland
which
probably
caused
many
idealistic
if
misguided
young
catholics
to
join
the
a
similar
effect
better
protected
if
the
security
services
rather
than
alerting
a
suspect
terrorist
by
placing
them
under
house
arrest
and
for
how
longthey
were
to
place
suspect
terrorist
under
surveillance
and
maybe
acquire
sufficient
evidence
to
prosecute
or
even
better
prevent
a
terrorist
for
mr
forsyths
largely
right
wing
views
but
this
time
he
has
got
it
spot
are
terrorist
organisations
who
would
like
to
do
harm
to
the
alqaeda
is
a
global
organisation
coordinating
cards
the
plan
to
charge
for
road
use
by
tracking
every
vehicle
at
all
times
this
is
the
stuff
of
which
effectively
means
that
the
protection
of
the
law
will
be
removed
from
anyone
at
the
whim
of
the
home
secretary
and
i
genuinely
wonder
what
sort
of
world
my
two
children
will
need
to
attack
the
people
terrorised
more
that
they
could
very
achieve
with
a
few
my
gut
fears
and
reservations
were
about
this
proposed
legislation
but
could
not

in
the
troubles
occurred
on
both
sides
of
the

out

killers
from
both

suspended
then
as
the
greatest
miscarriages
of
justice
during
those
the
islamic

will
just
do
the
is
armed
forces
as
the
soviet
threat
in
the
eastern
bloc
blitz
forget
suspects
foreign
and
british
were
routinely
rounded
up
and
interned
for
the
duration
of
the
war
without
any
complaints
from
the
at
of
an
attack
by
a
sleeper
cell
of
fundamentalist
lunatics
against
a
major
uk
target
is
a
when
not
an
if
that
the
day
after
any
such
attack
freddie
forsyth
will
be
saying
that
the
government
didnt
do
enough
to
protect
the
one
side
of
any
argument
and
for
him
it
is
the
side
that
is
opposite
new
labour
and
tony
been
such
a
wonderful
place
to
live
is
under
attack
not
from
terrorists
but
from
this
threat
is
not
because
of
what
the
alleged
terrorists
are
doing
but
from
our
own
doing
is
at
the
very
least
highly
questionable
and
at
worst
they
have
enough
control
over
every
single
person
in
the
british
isles
when
we
are
all
tagged
and
monitored
constantly
our
freedom
is
being
craftily
and
surreptitiously
whittled
away
by
this
government
and
we
are
gaining
to
forsyth
and
therefore
have
lived
through
the
same
history
as
and
would
not
like
to
think
that
i
lived
in
iraq
made
the
international
situation
worse
and
may
have
provoked
further
acts
of
britain
now
and
germany
during
the
so
easy
to
take
over
a
country
from
point
the
terrorists
who
threaten
britain
today
are
well
aware
that
hitler
stalin
and
the
ira
all
are
willing
to
do
things
their
predecessors
did
civil
liberties
of
modern
britain
must
be
eroded
to
counter
the
threat
that
should
always
be
the
absolute
last
to
defeat
the
sinister
fanaticism
of
todays
terrorists
we
may
need
to
do
things
a
little
to
be
a
wellthoughtout
analysis
of
why
we
human
society
as
a
whole
and
britain
in
particular
should
resist
the
temptation
to
overprotect
through
terrorists
to
succeed
in
the
end
and
terrorists
can
come
in
all
forms
as
attributed
to
thomas
the
name
of
security
will
have
neitherthe
government
are
faced
with
an
incredibly
difficult
task
and
have
made
a
policy
to
deal
with
policy
but
if
mr
forsythe
cant
draw
on
his
years
of
experience
to
offer
an
alternative
i
say
so
what
to
his
his
conclusions
own
prejudice
against
new
of
our
democracy
with
minimum
loss
of
civil
the
extremist
because
he
does
not
appreciate
the
need
for
my
forsyth
but
in
this
instance
i
think
he
is
civil
liberties
are
worth
without
charge
or
trial
whats
nexti
agree
loose
the
moral

in

fight
against
but
as
churchill
points
out
it
is
better
than
all
the
others
that
have
been
for
many
reasons
we
should
take
that
personal
risk
in
return
for
personal
is
that
of
a
government
dedicated
to
acting
illegally
and
manipulating
international
and
national
law
to
suit
its
own
justifying
a
range
of
extraordinary

greater

obviously
there

to
kill

maximum

of
their

so
as
to
maintain

among
the

are
the
negative
influence
of
the
us

interpretation
of
democracy
and
were
current
before
the
wwii
the
wars
to
liberate
iraq
afghanistan
with
syria
and
iran
to
for
the
future
and
should
keep
his
fiction
where
it
down
the
road
that
mr
forsyth
make
a
lot
of
people
believe
that
they
are
governed
by
people
who
are
fast
becoming
tyrants
instead
of
being
genuinely
committed
to
stopping
tyranny
even
if
the
method
employed
to
do
that
is
at
the
moment
alien
to
the
british
people
who
have
lived
in
a
democracy
protected
by
tony
blair
and
others
of
like

who
side
the
scruffy
little
austrianthomas
hobbes
would
be
smiling
in
his
grave
at
labours
a
was
promoting
the
peoples
best
hobbes
has
been
criticised
by
most
subsequent
philosophers
for
arguing
his
way
into
the
hands
of
the
favour
of
the
ultimate
liberty
the
liberty
to
live
man
should
be
prepared
to
surrender
all
other
liberties
to
a
supreme
sovereign
as
protection
against
his
fellow
barbaric
posterity
and
rightly
same
the
spirit
of
british
get
away
with
britain
winning
the
war
against
the
ira
and
hes
wrong
too
about
the
country
not
becoming
a
kill
torture
internment
without
trial
collusion
with
loyalist
death
squads
etcmy
background
is
somewhat
similar
to
freddies
so
i
am
persuaded
to
agree
with
many
of
his
for
imposing
our
system
of
government
on
anyone
while
we
are
systematically
depriving
our
own
citizens
of
basic
individual
and
collective
terrorists
under
house
arrest
might
seem
superficially
attractive
it
is
unfortunately
also
the
first
step
towards
a
suspect
why
should
we
believe
them
who
can
have
faith
in
the
honesty
integrity
and
competence
of
our
intelligence
services
and
politicians
in
light
of
the
events
of
recent
years
what
is
to
stop
false
denunciations
what
of
those
falsely
accused
who
will
lose
their
careers
who
will
support
their
families
will
their
children
still
go
to
school
it
smacks
to
me
of
the
methods
of
nazi
germany
stalins
russia
ceausescus
romania
the
list
goes
dark
age
is
forsyths
remarks
are
those
who
support
imprisonment
without
trial
believe
it
will
never
happen
to
them
or
their
family
only
to
people
they
dont
like
or
are
scared
you
have
laws
like
that
they
always
get
abused
by
those
in
scared
of
the
same
people
as
those
in
power
but
someday
those
in
power
may
be
scared
of
you
and
that
day
youll
be
the
one
imprisoned
without
the
chance
of
cannot
just
be
imprisoned
at
the
whim
of
our
police
forces
you
have
to
be
shown
to
be
deserving
of
for
an
indeterminate
period
we
are
no
better
that
those
we
are
me
to
agree
with
a
single
word
uttered
by
frederick
forsyth
but
im
in
wholehearted
agreement
with
him
on
this
grave
danger
of
being
duped
by
pro
us
propaganda
which
of
course
also
means
well
inherit
most
if
not
all
of
their
total
paranoia
and
allow
our
governments
of
any
political
persuasion
incidentally
to
gradually
and
insidiously
impose
a
police
state
by
well
tried
tested
back
door
my
children
its
no
wonder
theyre
adamant
they
dont
ever
want
any
of
their
us
up
to
the
european
convention
on
human
rights
but
now
wants
to
introduce
indefinite
house
arrest
without
with
the
government
of
wouldnt
usually
think
of
mr
forsyth
as
someone
whose
views
i
share
but
in
the
instance
of
opposing
charles
clarks
proposals
for
house
arrest
i
agree
wholeheartedly
with
mr
forsythi
agree
with
mr
government
along
with
the
us
invaded
another
sovereign
country
iraq
by
selecting
intelligence
that
backed
its
case
based
on
very
same
distorted
way
then
weve
done
ourselves
more
damage
than
any
terrorist
organisation
could
with
what
mr
forsyth
has
said
if
we
are
to
be
respected
and
have
influence
within
the
world
we
must
be
seen
to
be
walking
the
walk
as
well
as
talking
the
talk
how
can
we
accuse
countries
such
as
zimbabwe
and
burma
of
human
rights
abuses
when
we
are
locking
up
people
who
may
be
totally
innocent
it
is
hypocrisy
of
the
highest
the
new
misunderstood
the
term
islamic
a
muslim
who
adheres
to
the
true
fundamentals
of
the
quraan
and
the
teachings
of
the
last
prophet
muhammad
is
an
islamic
in
any
shape
or
form
nor
does
shehe
kill
innocent
women
men
and
tries
to
better
herhis
actions
by
being
good
to
the
new
threat
are
those
who
do
not
follow
the
correct
teachings
of
interpretations
and
assumptions
with
regards
their
to
be
following
islam
in
its
true
formi
accept
that
the
intentions
of
these
policies
are
to
make
britain
a
safer
place
but
i
cannot
think
of
a
single
example
from
history
where
doing
this
sort
of
thing
has
ever
made
any
difference
in
northern
ireland
internment
certainly
didnt
achieve
anything
the
bombings
didnt
stop
and
it
could
be
argued
that
all
it
achieved
was
to
just
supply
the
ira
with
yet
more
angry
and
resentful
republicans
willing
to
take
up
arms
against
the
forsyth
and
a
survivor
of
the
blitz
on
london
it
is
easy
to
agree
with
him
he
is
absolutely
spot
massive
explosions
in
canary

to
the
right
of
where
i
write
this
and
also
to
the
left
in
the

of
nearly
successful

attempts
on

and
on
later
occupants
of

there
was
no
retaliatory

on
belfast
or
dublin
as
there
has
been

from

telling
the

the
germans
are
the
big

here

they

he
did
not

the

were
offensive
and
worked
happily
with
meps
of
different
nationalities
in
the

only
reason
for
having
the
outdated
eu
as
there
was
no
economic
a

in
the
centre
of
europe
mr
nattrass
said
the
fact
is
that
the

benefits
germany
but
it
does
not
benefit
said
mike

some
passionate

and
sometimes
uses
excessively
colourful
language
with
which
to
express
themthe
documentary
showed
some
of
the
tensions
between
mr
kilroysilk
and
his
fellow
meps
after
ukip
took
third
place
in
last
years
european
until
october
thisisanumber
when
he
told
bbc
ones
breakfast
with
frost
programme
he
aspired
to
the
he
had
lied
about
his
leadership
ambitions
mr
kilroysilk
said
there
was
one
thing
i
said
that
i
shouldnt
have
said
at
the
to
the
party
and
it
was
the
wrong
thing
to
do
i
should
have
told
the
truth
the
film
also
included
footage
of
a
row
between
mr
kilroysilk
mep
nigel
farage
and
party
leader
roger
knapman
about
rumours
that
he
was
about
to
resign
the

in

not
left
the

a
move
he
announced
shortly
after
the

nigel
now
youve
told
too
caused
by
you
ukip
officials
claim
it
was
in
fact
mr
kilroysilk
not
mr
farage
who
briefed
newspapers
he
was
leaving
the
group
of
a
television
studio
mr
kilroysilk
was
heard
saying
he
was
irritated
by
defending
some
of
these
rightwing
fascist
argued
against
ukip
working
with
such
groups
which
believed
homosexuality
was
a
more
than
thisisanumber
meps
in
the
same
group
in
the
european
some
rightwing
some
leftwing
but
with
a
shared
belief
in
the
unfeasibility
of
the
eu
as
it
is
religious
beliefs
but
argued
it
was
their
right
to
hold
such
views
just
as
mr
kilroysilk
had
a
right
to
criticise
arab
robert
has
made
a
variety
of
comments
about
ukip
and
its
to
every
that
he
was
offered
several
positions
which
would
have
given
him
effective
control
of
the
party
but
not
the
title
of
leader
mr
kilroysilk
is
to
launch
his
own
parry

in
westminster
on
midlands
mep
robert
kilroysilk
said
he
wanted
to
change
the
face
of
british
politics
as
he
launched
his
new
uk
independence
party
said
our
country
was
being
stolen
from
us
by
mass
that
veritas
latin
for
truth
would
avoid
the
old
parties
lies
and
is
glad
to
see
the
back
of
mr
fair

on

and
said
they
hoped
to
contest

the
forthcoming

over

joining
an
already
crowded
field
on
the
right
of
british
to
announce
which
constituency
he
will
run
in
at
the
next
general
election
that
will
come
amid
speculation

set
on

venture
by
one
of
ukips
two
london
assembly
members
damien
hockney
who
is
now
veritas
deputy
the

will
just
be
a
parody
of
the
party
the
men
have
after
months
of
tension
as
he
vied
unsuccessfully
for
the
leadership
of
that
be
a
member
of
a
ukip
whose
leadership
had
gone
awol
after
the
great
opportunity
offered
by
its
third
place
at
last
junes
european
on
the
british
people
i
shall
not
he
next
general
campaign
for
the
causes
i
believe
shall
be
honest
open
and
straightmr
hockney
also
left
ukip
saying
mr
kilroysilk
would
deliver
better
as
the
leader
of
a
eurosceptic
mr
hockney
to
quit
the
london
has
a
moral
obligation
if
not
a
legal
one
to
stand
he
is
glad
to
see
the
back
of
mr
people
but
sadly
after
the
european
election
it
became
clear
that
he
was
more
interested
in
the
robert
kilroysilk
party
than
the
uk
independence
party
so
it
was
nice
knowing
him
now
goodbye
he
has
not
been
straightforward
in
attacking
the
party
he
once
wanted
to
expensive
suitits
all
well
and
good
robert
kilroysilk
claiming
that
veritas
is
a
party
that
doesnt
believe
in
lies
and
spin
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
its
completely
useless
due
to
proportional
representation
there
is
no
chance
that
veritas
will
have
any
chance
in
claiming
power
and
change
the
twohorse
race
a
publicity
stunt
which
has
just
been
used
as
a
smokescreen
for
his
antiislamism
slurs
which
got
him
sacked
from
the
immigration
are
shared
by
uk
government
ceased
to
be
a
paper
tiger
on
this
i
would
be
more
than
interested
in
kilroy
silk
opposing
geoff
hoongood
to
see
the
parties
of
the
right
splintering
in
the
way
the
parties
of
the
left
have
always
eurosceptic
wing
of
the
tory
party
all
fade
further
into
obscurity
so
we
can
have
some
truth
in
the
debate
about
of
the
eu
we
need
to
be
at
the
heart
of
europe
leading
it
and
driving
it
to
where
we
as
a
country
want
to
go
not
running
away
from
may
just
end
up
helping
new
labour
into
a
third
of
their
antieuropean
policies
have
any
relevance
outside
middle
from
rightwing
england
but
will
have
little
impact
in
wales
or
eurosceptic
parties
will
allow
them
to
slip
out
of
the
way
and
get
people
voting
for
real
political
parties
which
address
more
than
one
as
soon
as
people
realise
this
the
better
we
cant
rely
on
the

increasing
the

ill
be
voting
for
of
smallmindedness
and
a
lack
of
vision
for
the
whole
of

lie
so
much
beyond
the
scope
of
these
peoples
bickering
that
who
in
the
overall
scheme
of
things
really
cares
about
their
petty
tiffmany
people
believe
you
switching

midstream
and
then
bad
mouthing
the
steed
that
got
you
halfway
seriously
diminishes
your
born
out
of
such
negative
feelings
as
euroscepticism
or
british
supremacy
is
recognise
these
extremists
for
what
they
are
and
shun
them
at
the
a
selfpublicising
egotist
and
this
news
does
absolutely
nothing
to
alter
my
a
plausible
partyhaving
seen
the
recent
bbc
thisisanumber
documentary
and
witnessed
the
thoroughly
disgraceful
chauvinistic
behaviour
of
a
number
of
senior
ukip
figures
i
can
well
understand
why
kilroysilk
feels
embarrassed
to
be
associated
with
such
interested
in
the
political
debate
will
support
his
worry
about
from
the
they
have
been
since
the
thisisanumber
and
the
extreme
antieuropeans
are
fracturing
themselves
into
splinter
groups
that
split
any
votes
they
might
get
in
local
european
and
general
his
own
and
his
supporters
worst
be
more
delighted
by
kilroysilks
just
building
up
a
head
of
steam
and
having
exposed
it
to
ridicule
by
attempting
a
coupdetat
he
is
now
setting
about
the
serious
business
of
dividing
it
in
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
but
in
any
eventuality
the
two
sceptic
parties
will
exhaust
their
energies
fighting
each
lead
their
party
resorted
to
forming
their
own
for
that
purpose
wed
have
ballot
papers
a
mile
long
youve
got
to
hand
it
to
kilroysilk
for
his
sheer
arrogance
and
supreme
of
kilroy
i
do
agree
with
his
comments
about
the
ukip
leadership
and
like
him
i
am
also
leaving
lost
to
discredit
the
eu
and
to
show
our
people
what
belonging
to
the
eu
really
michael
howards
plans
to
reform
immigration
show
how
little
we
govern
our
own
country
when
they
can
turn
round
and
say
immigration
is
a
matter
for
the
eu
and
not
individual
member
superstate
the
betterdoes
anyone
else
think
that
it
is
ironic
that
eurosceptic
kilroysilk
has
used
a
latin
name
for
his
new
party
rather
than
a
good
old
british
name
is
this
indicative
of
the
man
contradictory
vain
and
pompousi
think
mr
kilroysilk
has
got
a
very
good
and
as
a
result
has
no
straight
talking
honest
strong
own

for
the

one

at

clearly
has
an

looking
at

that
seems
to
be
one
of
the
factors
in
think
he
is
doing
more
harm
than
good
for
both
his

because
their

base
is
not
strong
enough
for
both

and
at

ukip
have
the

then
he

but
now

not
the

with

thisisanumber
of
them
from

worth

the

can
see
who
gives
how
much
to

but
the
report
says
there
are
still
public
mean
taxpayers
giving

more

something
which
would
first
have
to
be
acceptable
to

we

sensible
says
its

it
should
be

a
small
enough
amount
to
make
a

but
which
would
have
banned
thisisanumber
in

between

urge
political

seek
out

smallscale

and
suggests
there
should

that
when
mr

got
the
clear
impression
the

chief
was
retiring
though
it
had
since

that

not

and
he
may

to

the

of
the

given

warning
this

will
not

these

liberal

repeated
his

calls
for
lord

first
piece
of
legal

to
be
made
claims
justifies
nonpublication
of
the
whole
of
the
advice
can
only
be
served
now
by
the
fullest
disclosurein
a
statement
to
newsnight
lord
goldsmith
said
in
my
parliamentary
answer
on
march
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
i
explained
my
genuinely
held
independent
view
that
military
action
was
lawful
under
the
existing
security
council
that
i
expressed
as
a
result
of
being
leaned
on
in
any
way
nor
as
i
have
already
made
clear
was
it
written
by
or
at
number
thisisanumber
the
prime
ministers
official
spokesman
also
rejected
the
claims
saying
the
attorney
general
made
it
clear
the
words
and
the
judgement
were
his
but
exforeign
secretary
robin
cook
says
all
the
advice
should
now
be
had
only
received
a
thisisanumber
of
lord
goldsmiths
second
opinion
and
that
it
was
actually
drafted
in
no
lord
goldsmith
had
signed
the
statement
mr
cook
said
because
the
attorney
generals
advice
should
be
an
independent
legal
opinion
not
subject
to
political
negotiation
of
this
legal
action
to
unseat
two
london
assembly
members
who
defected
to
robert
kilroy
silks
veritas
and
peter
hulmecross
were
elected
in
thisisanumber
on
the
list
give
up
their
seats
as
they
won
them
as
ukip
representatives
not
as
clear
that
those
elected
on
a
list
who
quit
their
party
should
keep
their
men
to
step
down
from
the
gla
in
a
legal
advice
and
it
is
clear
that
we
could
take
legal
proceedings
against
you
which
could
result
in
the
return
of
our
seats
andor
damages
against
be
given
an
opportunity
to
reflect
on
what
you
have
done
to
restore
your
own
credibility
with
the
electorate
and
return
the
seats
to
the
party
which
won
them
fair
and
square
at
the
last
election
mr
hockney
said
the
law
worked
in
exactly
the
same
way
for
the
gla
as
it
did
for
other
electoral
list
that
if
someone
resigns
who
was
elected
on
a
list
their
party
whip
the
seat
belongs
to
them
and
not
the
party
he
said
mr
hulmecross
and
himself
had
no
intention
of
resigning
and
added
that
they
felt
that
it
was
ukip
who
were
not
being
true
to
the
up
to
a
deal
with
the
tories
in
europe
rather
than
sticking
to
an
independent
ukip
spokesman
who
said
mr
hockneys
accusations
are
like
his
sense
of
political
morals
empty
veritas
was
formed
by
mr
kilroysilk
earlier
this
month
after
he
quit
ukip
following
an
unsuccessful
bid
to
take
over
as
politics
with
the
security
of
the
nationmichael
howard
has
no
doubt
it
is
the
prime
minister
who
he
claims
is
ramming
through
parliament
the
controversial
new
antiterror
measures
without
proper
tories
believe
the
prime
minister
is
playing
the
fear
card
on
this
one
so
he
can
look
tough
in
the
run
up
to
the
general
election
and
they
believe
tony
blair
is
using
the
issue
to
suggest
the
tories
are
soft
on
minister
not
simply
take
up
the
tories
offer
to
extend
the
existing
powers
temporarily
to
allow
proper
parliamentary
debate
of
the
laws
he
the
clearest
indication
that
it
is
the
tories
who
are
playing
politics
with
the
issue
by
attempting
to
score
cheap
political
points
in
the
proposed
laws
in
principle
in
which
case
delaying
a
decision
for
further
debate
would
be
pointlesswhat
this
is
really
about
believes
mr
blair
is
the
tories
spotting
an
opportunity
to
embarrass
maybe
even
defeat
the
them
than
national
suggesting
anyone
was
playing
politics
with
the
with
other
issues
like
id
cards
the
governments
immediate
instinct
was
prime
minister
was
less
rough
with
mr
kennedy
than
he
had
been
with
mr
howard
he
prefers
a
more
exasperated
tone
suggesting
he
believes
the
lib
dems
have
once
again
just
missed
the
electioneering
as
prime
minister
from
derby
norths
bob
laxton
asked
him
in
effect
if
he
would
carry
on
the
excellent
policy
of
pouring
more
resources
into
so
far
as
to
suggest
the
tories
were
such
a
shower
that
we
should
have
the
general
election
to
announce
election
day
he
doubt
that
that
announcement
is
just
days

an

the

it
has
been
by

ruling
national
executive
committee
in
a
break
with
the
traditional
choice
of
a
seaside
since
thisisanumber
that
the

has
chosen
manchester
to
host
the
annual
february

instead
in
what
will
be

as
a
placatory

and
annual

not

in
blackpool
will
be
seen
as
a
blow
in
the
coastal
would
not
return
to
blackpool
but
did
so
in
event
before
the
party
signed
a
two
year
deal
for
brighton
to
host
the
autumn
we
have
tried
very
hard
to
make
sure
they
come
back
to
the
party
which
is
a
working
class
party
doesnt
want
to
come
to
the
main
working

resort
in
the
country
the
exact
cost
to
blackpool
in
terms
of
lost
revenue
for
hotel
accommodation
is
not
yet
known
but
it
is
thought
that
block
bookings
will
be
taken
at
the
major
manchester
hotels
after
the
official
antisemitic
images
in
posters
which
critics
claim
depict
tory
leader
michael
howard
as
people
with
a
pocket
watch
saying
i
can
spend
the
same
money
twice
the
image
prompted
concern
from
the
editor
of
the
jewish
chronicle
but
labour
insists
it
is
simply
its
website
saying
an
alternative
idea
had
proved
more
popular
with
party
groups
to
test
a
poster
showing
mr
howard
and
shadow
chancellor
oliver
letwin
with
a
blackboard
reading
to
the
portrayal
of
the
dickens
character
fagin
in
the
stage
version
of
the
musical
oliver
there
was
controversy
over
another
poster
choice
offered
to
labour
letwin
who
are
both
jewish
as
flying
the
antisemitism
claims
when
asked
about
the
poster
on
blair
had
in
thisisanumber
complained
about
personalised
abusive
it
is
such
a
pity
that
mr
blair
doesnt
practise
what
he
preachesjewish
chronicle
editor
ned
temko
said
there
had
been
a
mixed
reaction
to
the
first
poster
but
emails
from
jewish
chronicle
readers
showed
deeper
concern
about
the
hypnotism
to
notions
of
centuriesold
prejudice
he
told
bbc
radio
thisisanumber
world
at
its
a
difficult
exercise
to
use
images
like
that
and
to
argue
that
you
can
divorce
them
from
their
historical
context
or
meaning
mr
temko
said
he
blamed
cockup
not
conspiracy
saying
he
did
not
detect
inherent
antisemitism
in
any
of
the
parties
election
a
series
of
ideas
shown
to
labour
members
who
have
been
asked
to
choose
which
one
should
be
used
ahead
of
the
hypnotism
image
was
insensitive
but
urged
people
not
to
rush
to
call
things
antisemitic
when
they
only
challenged
tory
economic
the
poster
had
been
as
a
hypnotist
he
we
have
to
take
those
views
on
board
but
i
would
emphasise
that
if
you
see
the
posters
the
common
to
con
you
a
labour
spokesman
later
said
the
timing
of
removing
the
controversial
image
from
the
partys
website
was
not
affected
by
the
website
for
two
weeks
and
there
has
only
been
a
fuss
in
the
last
four
days
so
a
substantial
number
of
people
voted
before
there
was
any
fuss
he
poster
campaign
which
was
offensive
to
many
people
was
a
big
misjudgement
by
labours
campaign
defended
his
partys
campaign
posters
amid
tory
claims
the
ads
were
nothing
short
of
sly
concerns
but
insisted
that
what
they
were
was
antitory
and
not
in
any
way
shape
or
form
julian
lewis
who
said
the
ads
were
part
of
a
wider
trend
of
smearing
the
and
launched
four
new
party
published
posters
appearing
to
depict
michael
howard
who
is
jewish
as
fagin
and
as
a
flying
pig
amid
claims
they
were
misjudgement
by
the
conservatives
who
said
labours
first
shot
in
the
election
has
badly
of
ideas
shown
to
labour
members
who
were
asked
to
vote
on
their
website
saying
members
preferred
other
on
tuesday
steer
clear
of
the
fagin
or
flying
pig
images
but
make
clear
that
labour
is
sticking
to
its
strategy
of
targeting
the
tory
leader
personally
with
reminders
of
his
record
in
of
ideas
shown
to
labour
members
who
have
been
asked
to
choose
which
one
should
be
used
ahead
of
the
lewis
suggested
the
posters
were
part
of
a
wider
trend
and
reminded
mps
that
labour
chairman
ian
mccartney
last
year
described
shadow
chancellor
oliver
letwin
as
a
thisisanumber
century
caused
then
how
could
you
have
thought
anything
other
than
the
fact
that
what
you
were
doing
in
reviving
it
in
your
poster
advertisements
was
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
than
a
calculated
campaign
of
sly
antisemitism
mr
milburn
replied
that
they
were
not
i
make
no
apologies
at
all
for
making
clear
to
the
british
public
exactly
what
the
conservative
plans
would
mean
he
the
views
of
those
who
have
concerns
about
any

appeared
on

stolen
from

by

fair

joining
an
already
crowded
field
on
the

of

by
one
of

two
london
assembly
members
damien

who
is
now
veritas
deputy
the

will
just
be
a
parody
of
the

the

have
after
months
of
tension
as
he
vied
unsuccessfully
for
the
leadership
of
that
be
a

of
a
ukip
whose
leadership
had
gone
awol
after
the
great
opportunity
offered
by
its
third
place
at
last
junes
european
he
is
glad
to
see
the
back
of
mr
people
but
sadly
after
the
european
election
it
became
clear
that
he
was
more
interested
in
the
robert
kilroysilk
party
than
the
uk
independence
party
so
it
was
nice
knowing
him
now
goodbye
he
has
not
been
straightforward
in
attacking
the
party
he
once
wanted
to
issues
politicians
from
the
big
parties
have
tiptoed
around
at
election
signalled
their
intention
of
making
them
central
to
their
election
level
of
concern
amongst
voters
about
the
issues
with
internal
surveys
showing
they
have
the
potential
to
swing
large
numbers
of
last
general
election
and
the
issue
did
briefly
become
a
campaigning
furore
with
claims
politicians
were
either
stoking
up
xenophobia
or
alternatively
running
scared
of
addressing
the
set
to
be
one
of
the
core
battlegrounds
with
both
the
big
parties
competing
to
set
out
tough
imposing
annual
limits
on
immigration
with
a
quota
for
asylum
seekers
and
with
applications
processed
outside
the
unworkable
but
party
strategists
have
seen
the
tories
seizing
a
poll
advantage
over
the
come
up
with
alternative
proposals
for
a
points
system
to
ensure
only
immigrants
who
can
benefit
the
economy
will
be
granted
entry
and
to
kick
out
more
failed
asylum
tories
as
too
little
too
late
and
for
failing
to
tackle
the
key
issue
of
the
numbers
entering
the
drawn
too
deeply
into
the
argument
but
have
called
for
a
europewide
policy
on
to
agree
the
time
has
come
to
properly
debate
and
address
the
issue
there
are
already
signs
they
will
run
into
precisely
the
same
problems
as
has
already
accused
both
the
big
parties
of
engaging
in
a
bidding
war
about
who
can
be
nastiest
to
asylum
labour
party
and
the
conservative
party
will
take
a
constructive
approach
to
the
debate
rightwing
political
parties
picking
up
on
statements
like
burden
to
britain
will
exploit
this
and
create
a
lot
of
fear
and
the
possible
suggestion
the
issue
is
playing
to
the
far
rights
racist
agenda
that
will
provoke
strong
reactions
from
many
concerned
with
this
is
to
ensure
they
can
engage
in
the
debate
during
the
cut
and
thrust
of
a
general
election
while
also
avoiding
that
begun
a
weeklong
tour
to
persuade
voters
they

mr

the

widely
tipped

would
be
much
more
unpredictable
than
any

in

he
said
theres
no

to
the

we
have
as

we
have
got
to
be
credible
we
have
got
to
demonstrate
to
people
that
we
are
up
to
that
taskmr
kennedy
said
the
british
public
felt
let
down
by
labour
on
issues
from
iraq
to
topup
fees
and
the
conservatives
were
not
asking
the
critical
sceptical
about
labour
and
conservative
promises
on
a
vote
for
his
party
would
mean
letting
the
tories
in
by
the
back
previous
parliamentary
byelections
the
liberal
democrats
have
demonstrated
that
not
only
can
we
leapfrog
the
conservatives
where
we
start
in
a
third
place
position
but
we
can
go
on
to
defeat
the
i
think
of
this
coming
general
hes
back
and
still
hungry
for
the
job
of
prime
minister
but
does
that
sum
up
the
mood
at
the
partys
spring
conference
in
gatesheadthe
electorate
are
keener
on
the
government
than
some
labour
party
members
is
the
dry
assessment
of
graham
lane
leader
of
the
labour
group
on
newham
is
not
continuing
divisions
over
iraq
foundation
hospitals
or
tuition
fees
or
even
voter
apathy
but
mr
blair
on
the
soon
his
friend
saxon
spence
leader
of
devon
county
labour
group
lays
the
blame
for
any
lack
of
campaigning
zeal
on
one
issue
above
all
the
war
in
party
who
had
some
key
rolesbut
the
two
friends
were
fired
up
by
gordon
browns
speech
on
saturday
with
its
appeal
to
core
labour
values
on
social
justice
health
and
a
little
jaded
but
it
reminded
us
why
we
joined
the

said
mrs
the

they
would
still
be
clapping
added
mr
spring
conference
there
was
an
equally
ardent
fan
of
mr

the
pms
speech
on
sunday
i
think
it
was
a
bit
of
a
turning
point
given
the
roasting
he
has
had
on
some
of
burnley

he
is
the

won

malcolm
shipley
of
shipley
said
it
was
as
if
he
is
coming
round
to
the
right
approach
said
mr
blair
had
shown
he
could
rouse
the
partys
grassroots
i
think
if
every
voter
was
able
to
spend
time
in
a
room
with
tony
the
way
we
have
today
we
will
have
no
problem
with
turnout
she
had
just
emerged
from
a
qa
session
in
which
mr
blair
tieless
and
supremely
at
ease
answered
questions
posed
via
the
partys
agreed
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
mr
blairs
leadership
and
they
were
adamant
that
the
campaigning
strength
of
the
party
in
their
city
was
as
strong
as
a
factor
for
most
at
the
moment
is
that
we
keep
getting
all
these
polls
saying
we
are
going
to
run
away
with
the
does
create
this
sense
of
complacency
among
our
own
voters
and
i
think
that
is
the
greater
problem
than
iraq
said
nottingham
city
councillor
brian
critics
seemed
to
agree
on
one
thing
he
is
a
master
of
the
sort
of
glossy
highprofile
campaigning
that
has
become
labours
hallmark
epitomised
by
fridays
whistlestop
tour
of
marginal
the
swan
hunter
shipyard
who
said
they
were
facing
redundancy
could
barely
suppress
their
anger
at
mr
blairs
failure
to
as
they
saw
it
shake
off
his
tory
leanings
and
stand
up
for
manufacturing
in
the
north

of

such
as

by

this

on

the

agreed
he
was
on
the
doorstep
pushing
the
labour
message
come

about

then
whats
the
point
there
is
no
complacency
as
far
as
i
can
see
in
the
labour
said
richie
was
becoming
increasingly
difficult
to
think
of
an
answer
when
people
asked
what
has
labour
done
for
the
north
east
i
have
had
doors
slammed
in
my
face
he
they
were
proud
of
what
they
believed
labour
had
achieved
in
their
local
communities
the
new
hospitals
and
schools
the
better

chances
for

was
converting
this
local
feelgood
factor
into

the
millions
of

who
have
signed
up
to
make
sure
they
do
not
get
marketing
cold
to
the
rules

that
their

are
not

for

by
asking
about

people
had
to
be
told
if

backed
by

much
to

as
to

and
the
tories
are
not
calling
people
signed
up
to
the
bbc

website
the
party
avoided
those
on
tps
lists
when
telephoning
people
about
membership
or
voter
identification
will
vote
for
that
is
not
marketing
and
we
have
very
clear
legal
advice
that
it
is
not
he
the
telephone

said
the
party
always
asked
people
if
they
would
be

no
they

was

if

he
significant

its

the

nothing

that
the
tory
strategy
was
to
win

they
were

he
will
stand
down
at

mr

held
a
number
of
shadow
roles
including

when
he
decided
to
ban
beef
on

wake
of

in
recent

has
served
as

has
been
a
loyal
supporter
of

from
the
full
scale
of
his
planned
tory
tax
election
he
has
earmarked
thisisanumber
billion
that
will
be
used
to
reduce

although
he
still
will
not
say
which
or
in
his

have
been
pressing
for

he
believes
will
warm
vote
tory
and
you
can
have
it
both
to
labour
spending
plans
on
core
public
services
including
health
and
education
it
would
increase
spending
on
defence
police
and
it
would
still
have
enough
left
over
for
a
tax
cut
equivalent
to
about
a
penny
off
the
basic
rate
of

its
thisisanumber

which
would

the

taken

the

on

with
thisisanumber
billion
to
fill
the
black
hole
left
they
claim
by
gordon
brown
and
the
rest
going
in

would
say
exactly
how
they
would
use
that

although
a
cut
in
the
basic

seems
thresholds

abolishing

reducing

tax
although
some
in
the
tory
party
are
urging
mr

to
announce
something
more
eyecatching

the
aim
of
the
exercise
is
to
open
up
a

between
labour
and
the
a
clear
choice
between
mr

who
will
waste
more
and
tax
more
and
the
conservative
party
which
will
give
value
for
money
and
tax
less
he
an
almost
traditional
tory
message
which
previously
suggested
labour
was
the
party
of
tax
rises
and
the
conservatives
the
party
of
tax
that
labour
was
also
seen
as
the
party
of
big
spending
on
the
public

while
the
tories
were
the
the
problems
lies
for
mr

can
he
persuade
sceptical
voters
that
they
really
can
have
it
both
ways
with
bigger
spending
on
public
services
and
lower
taxes
he
insists
he
will
not
promise
anything
before
the
election
that
he
cannot
deliver
if
put
into
downing
planned
thisisanumber
efficiency
savings
simply
dont
add
up
and
that
those
sorts
of
figures
are

to
persuade
voters
business
and
the
city
that
it
could
be
trusted
to
run
the
any
real
challenge

independent
analysts
now
claim
a

new

would
be
forced
to
either
increase
taxation
or

to
plug
a

are
the
future
while
michael
howard
and
the
tories
would
take
the
country
years
before
thisisanumber
as
the
good
old
days
he
because
things
would
inevitably
boil
down
to
a
choice
between
labour
and
the
democrat
leader
charles
kennedy
walking
up
downing
street
the
day
after
or
of
course
tony
blair
doing
the
campaign
concentrated
on
rigorously
examining
the
oppositions
policies
and
past
the
very
front
line
of
that
campaign
he
prime
minister
will
be
spending
more
time
out
of
london
than
in
it
but
in
britain
not
overseas
he
debate
from
the
front
listening
taking
the
flak
so
lets
get
on
with
it
go
to
the
polls
to
elect
their
own
area
police
commissioner
under
plans
unveiled
by
the
new
role
would
replace
inconspicuous
police
not
supersede
the
job
of
a
chief
could
let
extreme
groups
run
policing
while
labour
criticised
extravagant
tory
promises
on
of
the
police
federation
of
england
and
wales
which
represents
rank
and
file
officers
said
it
was
essential
operational
independence
was
service
not
a
political
football
to
be
kicked
around
every
time
an
election
with
extreme
political
views
dictating
what
actually
happens
on
the
ground
she
said
elected
police
commissioners
would
be
more
accountable
than
police
authorities
which
are
made
up
of
local
councillors
and
which
existing
police
authorities
have
he
told
bbc
radio
thisisanumber
today
reflection
on
the
people
who
are
on
the
police
authority
they
are
good
people
but
hardly
anyone
knows
who
they
are
mr
howard
said
the
authorities
were
not
providing
the
local
accountability
that
we
want
to
see
and
that
elected
police
commissioners
would
be
more
control
of
the
police
to
singleissue
campaigners
who
would
ignore
the
needs
of
the
wider
executive
of
association
of
police
authorities
said
the
plans
seemed
to
suggest
chief
constables
should
be
told
what
to
do
by
a
single
of
the
way
in
which
we
have
organised
policing
in
this
country
to
avoid
the
politicisation
of
policing
decisions
he
oaten
said
the
plan
was
dangerous
and
could
create
conflict
between
chief
constables
and
elected
too
little
control
over
policing
but
a
far
better
solution
would
be
for
elected
councillors
to
draw
up
a
minimum
policing
guarantee
with
their
chief
howards
record
saying
police
numbers
had
fallen
by
thisisanumber
when
he
was
home
making
more
extravagant
promises
on
the
police
without
making
clear
how
they
would
pay
for
them
other
than
through
fantasy
savings
to
the
asylum
system
the
tories
insists
the
commissioner
role
would
not
be
like
that
of
an
american
include
building
more
prisons
and
making
criminals
serve
full
jail

it

that
it

up

whether
a

go

cancel

explain
their
reasons

they
would

you

you

lie
about
anything

blair
said
that
whether
the
public
chose
michael
howard

mr

it
would
result
in
a
tory

a

not
move
other

then
attacking

vacuous

was
very
worried

take
revenge
for
his
failure
to
newspaper
reports
that
the

brown
using
his
budget
to
fire
both
barrels
at
some
of
the
opposition
parties
core
election
slaughter
the
council
tax
as
an
election
issue
and
to
tear
limb
from
limb
their
wider
policies
for
pensioners
and
kept
the
best
for
last
and
was
clearly
out
to
give
exactly
that
preelection
boost
everyone
had
been
with
children
a
pensioner
a
patient
or
a
youngster
there
was
something
pulled
from
mr
browns
red
box
in
an
attempt
to
persuade
you
to
stick
with
or
switch
to
a
new
labour
target
his
handouts
with
absolute
precision
onto
exactly
the
groups
the
government
needs
to
appeal
to
in
the
election
his
own
mps
who
are
now
in
fullon
election
mode
and
had
been
looking
to
their
man
to
give
them
ammunition
for
the
that
for
them
and
coincidentally
given
his
own
image
as
a
prime
ministerinwaiting
another
little
now
engage
in
a
debate
over
exactly
how
redistributive
a
lovely
old
labour
word
this
chancellor
really
to
put
on
a
show
and
even
as
he
was
out
to
cast
himself
as
the
man
who
will
win
labour
an
historic
third
term
his
demeanour
remained
quiet
confident
and
the
end
of
his
address
as
he
assured
voters
he
would
do
nothing
to
mess
up
the
economic
stability
he
had
brought
to
britain
and
which
he
claimed
would
be
thrown
away
by
anyone
it
is
all
one
big
con
glossing
over
the
facts
of
the
black
hole
at
the
centre
of
his
finances
which
they
claim
would
ensure
tax
increases
after
the
his
increase
in
national
insurance
contributions
after
the
thisisanumber
election
campaign
during
which
he
had
pledged
not
to
increase
income
claimed
for
most
families
the
distinction
between
income
tax
and
a
tax
on
income
is
chancellor
was
up
to
his
old
trick
of
deliberately
recasting
his
forecasts
to
give
the
illusion
that
everything
in
the
treasury
larder
is
as
fresh
as
the
day
it
was

stored
away

budget
based
on
dodgy
figures
from
a
dodgy
government
that
gave
britain
the
dodgy

mr
howard
felt
no
such
constraint
with
attacks
like
comparing
mr
browns
forecasts
to
the
prime
ministers
forecasts
on
iraqs

a
period
of
frantic
activity
by
the

specialists
as
they
pore
over
the
chancellors
red
book
which
sets
out
the
fine
detail
of
his
budget
in
an
attempt
to
spot
the
argument
over
precisely
whose
policies
on
the
council
tax
will
offer
people
the
best
undoubtedly
be
an
argument
over
just
how
good
a
prime
minister
gordon
brown
will
make
at
some
point
after
the
next
the
fundamental
unfairness
in
the
tax
system
in
his
ninth
budget
charles
kennedy
has
poorest
thisisanumber
of
society
were
still
paying
more
as
a
proportion
of
their
income
than
the
richest
thisisanumber
the
lib
dem
leader
for
pensioners
did
nothing
to
fix
the
unfair
tax
he
patching
up
the
system
he
brown
had
delivered
what
is
widely
thought
to
be
the
last
budget
before
the
general
election
mr
kennedy
acknowledged
that
the
uk
was
one
of
the
most
successful
economies
in
the
and
the
tories
for
failing
to
address
the
ticking
bomb
of
council
tax
wales
indicated
seven
million
households
in
england
would
pay
significantly
more
after
to
offer
a
thisisanumber
council
tax
rebate
paid
by
pensioner
households
was
merely
a
sticking
plaster
to
a
much
bigger
local
income
tax
would
benefit
the
typical
household
by
more
than
thisisanumber
a
year
with
half
of
all
pensioners
paying
no
local
tax
and
about
three
million
being
better
was
a
scandal
that
the
system
discriminated
against
women
who
had
missed
making
national
insurance
payments
when
they
were
having
end
at
a
stroke
this
fundamental
of
free
longterm
care
for
the
elderly
abolishing
topup
fees
and
replacing
the
council
tax
would
be
funded
by
charging
thisisanumber
income
tax
to
those
earning
more
than
thisisanumber
per
browns
pledge
in
thisisanumber
not
to
increase
income
up
national
insurance
contributions
after
the
households
it
adds
up
to
exactly
the
same
thing
said
mr
cynical
about
their
politicians
when
they
give
one
impression
before
an
election
and
do
exactly
the
opposite
after
that
gordon
browns
budget
as
vote
now
pay
later
spending
a
new
labour
government
taxes
would
go
up
after
the
election
to
plug
a
financial
black
hole
mr
howard
but
these
hid
tax
rises
for
hard
working
families
he
be
helped
by
the
package
of
measures
mr
howard
what
was
good
for
the
country
but
all
about
the
interests
of
the
labour
party
the
tory
leader
said
after
mockingly
welcoming
the
chancellor
back
to
the
election
brown
of
giving
with
one
hand
while
taking
away
with
the
he
had
been
responsible
for
dragging
millions
of
people
in
to
the
net
to
pay
stamp
duty
and
inheritance
but
they
hide
the
crippling
tax
rises
for
hardworking
families
that
are
inevitable
if
labour
winshe
also
accused
the
government
and
the
chancellor
of
running
out
of
solutions
to
the
problems
britain
to
spend
and
to
waste
to
get
people
to
vote
now
and
pay
later
mr
brown
liked
to
rattle
off
magical
balances
conjured
out
of
thin
air
in
a
bid
to
convince
people
there
was
no
black
hole
in
the
nations
finances
the
tory
leader
the
dodgy
dossier
is
now
publishing
a
dodgy
budget
based
on
dodgy
numbers
he
the
next
six
years
no
less
than
thisisanumber
billion
so
much
for
no
better
than
the
prime
ministers
forecasts
of
weapons
of
mass
destructionmr
browns
council
tax
rebate
for
pensioners
was
thisisanumber
less
than
what
the
tories
were
offering
mr
howard
that
would
put
more
police
on
the
streets
make
hospitals
cleaner
or
give
parents
and
teachers
the
discipline
and
skills
they
wanted
in
at
the
election
either
more
waste
and
higher
taxes
under
labour
or
lower
taxes
and
value
for
money
with
the
conservatives
he
to
be
all
about
and
i
say
bring
it
on

concluded
to
loud
tory

to
free
up

and

brown
said
thisisanumber
savings
had
already
been
made
and
more
jobs
had
been
cut
than
had
been
expected
at
this
department
of
the

said
the

had
been
cut

of

into

by
one
civil
service
union
as
a
bonfire
of

commercial
services
union
said
in
last
years
budget
we
had
the
day
of
the
long
knifes
as
the
chancellor
kicked
off
the
crude
game
of
who
could
cut
the
most
civil
service
jobs
between
the
government
and
the
only
worry
thousands
of
hard
working
civil
and
public
servants
had
on
budget
day
was
whether
petrol
or
taxes
would
go
up
nowadays
the
worry
is
whether
they
will
have
a
job
by
the
end
of
it
he
said
mr
brown
had
made
welcome
announcements
on
closing
tax
loopholes
and
extending
the
new
deal
while
cutting
the
very
people
who
deliver
them
the
treasury
also
announced
plans
to
reduce
the
number
of
public
sector
workers
on
sick
leave
with
a
new
system
of
checks
and
tougher
measures
against
those
suspected
of
abusing
the
nations
to
fund
a
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
plan
to
fight
the
aids
epidemic
and
find
a
sixday
tour

the

chancellor
predicted
a
vaccine
could
be
found
by
thisisanumber
if
the
world
stepped
up
its
funding
on
finding
such
a
vaccine
could
advance
it
by
three
years
and
save
six
million
lives
mr
brown
said
on
thisisanumber
presidency
to
push
the
issue
provided
the
finance
to
combat
cure
and
eradicate
the
worlds
deadliest
disease
of
today
and
today
the
worlds
least
curable
disease
hivaids
will
rightly
earn
the
title
the
great
generation
mr

said
in
a
speech
during
his
african
from
poverty
he
thisisanumber
is
needed
to
address
the
hivaids
crisis
in

not
stop
the

so
important
increasing

mr
brown
also
said
he
had
agreed
with
the
italian
finance
minister
domenico
siniscalco
to
push
forward
with
plans
for
the
worldwide
sharing
and
coordination
of
research
into
the
spending
thisisanumber
a
year
on
seeking
an
inoculation
and
the
market
needed
boosting
mr
brown
commit
themselves
to
buying
the
first
thisisanumber
vaccines
at
a
cost
of
thisisanumber
each
thereby
boosting
the
market
for
inducement
to
create
much
stronger
interest
from
both
large
and
small
pharmaceutical
firms
mr
brown
finance
the
treatment
and
care
of
those
living
with
hivaids
and
their
families
he
browns
preoccupation
with
finding
a
vaccine
and
called
on
thisisanumber
nations
to
fund
hivaids
britain
simon
wright
said
while
encouraging
the
pharmaceutical
industry
to
discover
an
hiv
vaccine
is
important
a
failure
to
provide
any
funding
for
hiv
treatments
condemns
a
generation
of
people
to
the
most
productive
adults
who
should
be
working
caring
for
children
and
building
the
least
thisisanumber
years
mr
brown
visited
slums
in
the
kenyan
capital
in
tanzania
and
a
womens
credit
union
in
mozambique
before
chairing
a
meeting
of
the
commission
for
africa
in
cape
for
a
thisisanumber
aid
package
which
he
has
likened
to
the
marshall
plan
used
by
the
united
states
to
rebuild
europe
after
world
war
to
tackle
the
problems
facing
britain
and
has
failed
michael
howard
has
direction
the
conservative
leader
said
in
his
new
year
interfering
government
that
takes
decisions
that
should
be
made
by
individuals
he
responded
britain
is
working
dont
let
the
tories
wreck
it
the
nations
character
for
its
generous
response
to
the
asian
quake
for
the
future
at
this
usually
positive
time
of
the
year
mr
howard
with
a
sense
of
of
what
happened
on
boxing
day
is
difficult
to
light
on
our
nations
the
warm
caring
heart
of
britain
beats
as
strong
as
ever
he
went
on
to
reflect
on
the
values
that
most
britons
hold
election
he
pledged
to
turn
these
beliefs
into
reality
and
set
out
the
choices
he
says
are
facing
to
pay
who
will
give
taxpayers
value
for
money
the
clean
hospitals
and
good
disciplined
schools
they
want
who
can
be
trusted
to
get
a
grip
on
the
disorder
on
our
streets
and
the
chaos
in
our
immigration
systemmr
blair
has
failed
to
tackle
these
problems
he
claimed
saying
he
has
the
wrong
solution
to
higher
taxes
eroding
incentives
undermining
enterprise
and
denying
people
government
that
has
wasted
peoples
money
and
failed
to
tackle
the
problems
families
face
today
the
tories
he
said
can
cut
crime
and
improve
public
services
without
asking
people
to
pay
more
what
makes
britain
great
its
tolerance
the
respect
for
the
rule
of
law
the
ability
of
everyone
to
fulfil
their
chance
to
change
this
is
the
record
mr
blair
will
have
to
defend
in
the
coming
months
he
said
urging
voters
to
hold
him
to
it
would
be
more
appropriate
for
this
message
to
come
out
on
thisisanumber
april
not
thisisanumber
january
let
us
never
forget
that
when
michael
howard
was
in
government
britain
suffered
mass
unemployment
thisisanumber
interest
rates
record
home
repossessions
and
the
introduction
of
the
poll
michael
howard
should
be
starting
thisisanumber
with
an
apology
to
the
british
people
for
the
misery
that
the
government
of
which
he
was
a
member
inflicted
upon
the
the
law
lords
ruling
that
detention
of
foreign
terror
suspects
without
trial
is
unlawful
mary
robinson
has
rights
and
irish
president
told
radio
thisisanumber
today
the
governments
response
would
be
scrutinised
the
government
did
not
accept
the
judgement
and
then
work
within
it
she
detainees
will
not
be
freed
at

in
office
as

secretary
following
david
blunketts
resignation
mr
clarke
said
i
will
be
asking
parliament
to
renew
this
legislation
in
the
new
studying
the
judgement
carefully
to
see
whether
it
is
possible
to
modify
our
legislation
to
address
the
concerns
raised
by
the
house
of
lordsmrs
robinson
said
the
law

ruling
was
in
line
with
international
legal
opinion
and
praised
their
very
decisive
eight
to
one
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
government
but
say
that
there
had
been
a
disproportionate
use
that
it
amounted
to
executive
detention
and
it
was
discriminatory
because
it
didnt
apply
to
british
citizens
she
of
action
by
the
british
government
could
lead
to
further
action
in
legal
arenas
such
as
the
european
court
of
human
rights
in
accept
this
ruling
then
there
is
further
redress
including
possible
damages
for
the
individuals
who
could
claim
that
the
government
either
was
tardy
or
was
resisting
the
implications
of
the
judgement
of
the

lords

of

leaders
to
be
held
in

spanish
capital
on
the

anniversary
of
the
train
bombings
there
would
probably
discuss
the
ruling
and
its
judgement
will
be
looked
at
both
as
a
very
positive
step
in
clarifying
the
law
and
restating
the
fundamental
principles
but
also
the
response
of
the
british
government
will
be
under
quite
a
