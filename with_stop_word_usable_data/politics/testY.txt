therefore
is
good

hinted
the

might
go
into

very
low

indeed
who
really
shouldnt
be
paying

he
taxes

over
be
effectively
almost
twice
the
us
minimum
wage
yet
our
economy
per
person
is
only
thisisanumber
of
the
us
perhaps
we
have
to
really
starting
questioning
why
some
products
cost
thisisanumber
more
here
than
they
do
in
the
would
make
the
pounds
the
lowpaid
people
do
make
go
much
got
a
part
time
job
at
thisisanumber
when
i
was
doing
my
alevels
in
an
attempt
to
get
a
little
money
saved
for
and
i
was
getting
paid
thisisanumber
an
hour
and
working
as
hard
as
any
of
the
older
staff
maybe
its
about
time
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
year
olds
got
a
fair
wagewe
must
remember
that
the
minimum
wage
is
only
part
of
the
picture
and
must
not
rise
to
a
level
that
makes
employing
people
unattractive
and
encourages
businesses
to
send
work
and
therefore
jobs
staff
via
their
contractors
that
pay
at
the
minimum
wage
or
very
close
to
to
do
as
it
preaches
would
be
to
insist
on
floor
pay
levels
for
all
government
workers
and
take
tens
of
thousand
of
civil
servants
out
of
the
social
security
system
all
the
pressures
of
an
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
i
would
simply
ask
them
would
you
be
happy
to
work
for
less
than
thisisanumber
an
of
these
comments
are
against
the
minimum
wage
also
i
personally
take
great
offence
at
the
insinuation
that
people
earning
minimum
wage
were
lazy
at
school
if
everyone
went
to
university
then
who
would
serve
you
in
the
supermarkets
and
clean
up
after
you
its
about
time
that
these
hardworking
people
are
rewarded
with
only
what
they
deserve
and
have
earned
fair
pay
and
a
bit
of
respect
wouldnt
go
a
miss
sense
of
equality
back
into
a
workers
relationship
with
their
fair
reflection
of
an
employees
point
of
exploitation
what
could
an
employer
get
away
a
pressure
to
keep
lowpaid
wages
pressure
is
at
least
partly
the
comments
from
so
called
business
the
rights
and
privileges
of
boards
to
award
fatcat
salaries
bonuses
and
pension
rights
to
the
select
few
but
they
are
the
first
to
attack
policies
that
are
put
in
place
to
merely
defend
the
rights
of
those
that
really
make
those
fat
cats
purri
feel
there
are
both
negatives
and
positives
to
the
increase
on
one
hand
some
businesses
will
struggle
to
stay
afloat
but
on
the
other
hand
in
today
world
many
young
people
cant
afford
to
move
out
as
property
costs
too
much
and
only
by
earning
more
will
they
be
able
to
get
on
in
but
the
minimum
wage
could
be
looked
at
as
more
of
a
stepping
stone
rather
than
a
hand
how
difficult
it
will
be
for
businesses
we
all
remember
michael
howards
protestations
that
the
minimum
wage
would
cost
a
million
jobs
when
it
was
introduced
funny
how
hes
gone
quiet
on
that
one
jobs
have
continued
to
increase
since
this
humane
legislation
was
brought
worth
doing
then
its
worth
being
paid
a
fair
wage
for
and
thisisanumber
is
hardly
a
workers
a
decent
wage
then
maybe
its
not
being
run
properly
and
if
it
folds
a
betterrun
company
will
take
over
its
duties
and
employ
more
people
so
everybody
wins
except
incompetent
business
ownersgreat
keep
at
it
tony
i
remember
the
despair
of
the
thisisanumber
and
the
low
wages
employers
got
away
difference
to
people
and
reward
them
for
a
decent
price
economy
goodbye
sweatshops
hello
a
good
prices
and
rent
have
increased
hugely
like
the
rest
of
the
country
over
the
past
thisisanumber
years
has
made
living
for
you
average
thisisanumber
years
old
very
in
living
costs
have
not
been
matched
by
an
increase
in
pay
for
example
a
job
i
did
in
plymouth
was
underpaid
to
an
equivalent
worker
in
exeter
by
thisisanumber
an
wage
will
bring
in
to
balance
pay
on
a
regional
and
national
level
and
in
turn
allow
people
like
myself
who
do
work
hard
but
might
never
earn
a
thisisanumber
figure
salary
the
chance
to
branch
out
on
our
where
the
contractors
providing
all
ancillary
services
domestic
catering
portering
etc
pay
the
minimum
wage
of
thisisanumber
as
the
basic
jobs
and
earn
enough
to
live
lazy
or
complacent
for
accepting
these
jobs
and
these
wages
who
do
they
think
will
be
carrying
out
these
public
service
jobs
if
contractors
are
allowed
to
pay
as
little
as
their
consciences
allowthis
is
definitely
the
right
step
in
the
right
for
the
low
income
earners
as
not
deny
people
the
minimum
wage
increase
its
timing
raft
of
bribes
to
come
from
the
government
before
the
election
and
a
raft
of
taxes
afterwards
they
are
playing
us
for
the
fools
they
think
we
any
business
whether
they
are
small
and
medium
enterprises
or
even
large
will
be
an
almost
certain
rise
in
costs
to
the
consumer
who
while
they
openly
welcome
the
idea
of
an
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
are
the
same
people
who
still
want
to
buy
that
shirt
or
that
pair
of
trainers
for
next
to
bring
will
only
be
reflected
in
the
price
of
the
goods
we
buy
which
in
turn
will
only
serve
to
discourage
companies
from
settingup
business
in
the
uk
or
encourage
those
companies
already
based
here
to
look
here
will
soon
give
way
to
misery
as
they
lose
their
reduction
in
centre
jobs
gone
to
and
stable
economy
however
consumer
debt
and
the
countrys
debt
is
at
its
highest
and
now
they
heap
this
onto
businesses
that
will
have
no
choice
but
to
cut
the
be
exposed
as
the
minimum
wage
is
blatant
the
one
time
when
elites
really
have
to
worry
about
doing
something
concrete
for
the
figures
being
thisisanumber
hour
week
at
thisisanumber
gives
you
an
annual
income
just
over
thisisanumber
and
raising
it
to
thisisanumber
leaves
it
under
government
under
pressure
for
much
a
look
at
corporate
pay
shareholder
payouts
and
profits
before
wondering
if
paying
a
living
wage
is
really
a
controlling
factor
in
the
viability
of
their
minimum
wage
of
workers
to
a
reasonable
level
but
we
have
to
accept
that
with
this
will
come
competition
from
overseas
be
able
to
afford
this
manpower
change
in
it
work
being
lost
to
india
where
people
are
paid
much
understand
that
only
five
years
ago
cheap
labour
abroad
was
classified
as
sweat
shop
but
now
we
are
told
it
is
global
decline
the
country
cannot
be
entirely
service
industries
without
something
tangible
to
the
top
of
the
food
chain
and
that
is
looked
might
be
because
i
work
for
minimum
hopefully
be
an
incentive
to
those
who
live
to
claim
to
actually
get
a
claiming
than
you
can
from
work
there
is
no
a
very
large
number
of
smes
will
have
to
close
this
will
put
more
people
out
of
the
unemployment
figures
the
government
know
it
is
not
big
business
that
keeps
the
economy
going
but
the
smes
but
we
always
get
overlooked
they
will
only
take
notice
if
these
large
corporations
close
and
move
to
other
countries
after
all
they
are
predominantly
owned
by
foreign
with
these
increases
have
already
had
an
effect
on
us
and
we
have
lost
work
another
one
will
close
low
pay
that
this
increase
is
being
put
forward
i
am
extremely
concerned
at
the
implications
for
small
nursery
i
know
this
increase
will
cause
great
hardship
for
my
employer
who
has
been
unable
to
increase
salaries
for
higher
paid
employees
because
of
last
octobers
increase
for
the
lower
paid
employees
who
were
originally
being
paid
slightly
above
the
minimum
but
are
now
on
the
hour
will
cause
even
more
financial
then
i
can
foresee
many
small
businesses
having
to
pay
off
have
a
serious
effect
on
my
level
we
will
have
to
increase
our
pay
rates
to
maintain
the
and
without
significant
increases
in
sales
it
will
mean
that
i
will
not
be
taking
on
a
new
member
of
staff
as
planned
and
i
will
be
looking
to
reduce
the
total

worked
by
the

of

overtime
being
the
first
to
wages
mirror
the
national
minimum
all
of
my
business
is
conducted
with
local
authorities
who
will
not
accept
above
inflation
rises
in
my
service
hidden
is
that
the
thresholds
for
tax
credits
do
not
move
in
line
with
these
increases
so
that
all
that
happens
is
that
employees
tax
credit
support
is
reduced
by
the
amount
of
the
increase
thereby
saving
the
government
money
but
increasing
the
financial
burden
on
small
to
medium
businessesit
is
very
good
that
the
government
has
decided
to
increase
the
minimum
wage
this
should
hopefully
motivate
people
to
undertake
the
lower
status
dont
bother
getting
qualifications
laze
about
at
school
no
need
to
do
anything
other
than
attend
so
your
parents
dont
get
fined
because
remember
when
you
do
eventually
start
working
doesnt
matter
how
lazy
you
are
youll
be
guaranteed
a
decent
business
have
to
pay
this
new
rate
that
mr
blair
and
mr
brown
will
increase
tax
allowances
and
raise
national
insurance
thresholds
so
that
the
treasury
wont
take
some
of
this
increase
off
the
people
they
say
they
are
helping
or
is
this
just
another
form
of
stealth
tax
on
business
through
the
back
doori
dont
believe
in
the
minimum
wage
at
all
i
think
jobs
should
create
their
own
wage
value
and
that
if
people
want
higher
wages
they
should
earn
am
some
richkid
i
can
assure
you
i
am
working
class
background
and
started
work
thisisanumber
years
ago
on
a
youth
opportunity
program
earning
thisisanumber
per
part
time
got
my
alevels
and
degree
bettered
and
getting
off
my
earned
thisisanumber
per
week
it
was
worth
to
be
near
to
thisisanumber
to
have
the
equivalent
buying
successive
governments
holding
down
the
tax
allowance
threshold
below
inflation
people
earning
the
minimum
wage
are
paying
taxes
that
they
never
would
have
done
thisisanumber
years
ago
at
equivalent
a
view
that
belong
in
the
your
day
thisisanumber
years
agoas
a
graduate
working
for
minimum
wage
i
welcome
any
increase
of
pay
i
can
i
have
to
work
harder
to
get
more
a
degree
and
have
chosen
to
work
for
a
small
business
that
cant
afford
the
wages
i
should
be
getting
i
should
be
on
at
least
thisisanumber
what
im
getting
but
they
cant
afford
money
is
just
not
love
my
job
and
wouldnt
change
it
just
to
get
more
several
shops
the
last
rise
in
the
minimum
wage
cost
my
company
an
additional
thisisanumber
per
from
somewhere
so
pass
it
on
to
the
regarding
no
one
really
wins
in
the
he
wins
because
he
obviously
has
announced
this
to
be
a
vote
winner
and
his
treasury
wins
because
as
an
employer
you
will
know
that
the
amount
of
tax
and
national
insurance
that
the
government
will
receive
from
all
the
minimum
wage
increases
will
rise
and
of
course
not
only
will
be
paying
out
higher
wages
but
as
an

higher

ni

as
and
if
it
hits
anywhere
near
the

mark
there
will
be
thisisanumber

the

console

conflict
with

in

dark
over
the
contents
of

until
the
last
possible

labour
mps
took
the

step
of
making
a
direct
appeal
to
the
two
men
stop
bickering
for
the

to
do
its
job
is
open
to
called
in
the
run
up
to
the

spat
was

being
brought
in
over
the
head
of
mr

to
run
the

to
get

thus
far
there
are
reports
that
mr
brown
using
the
budget
as
a
springboard
is
to
revitalise

to
forget
that
mr

remains
the
man
most
likely
to
succeed
mr

as

possible
contenders
for
the
crown
including
mr
milburn
but
none
can
command
the
sort
of
support
in
the
parliamentary
party
and
beyond
that
mr

his
own
retirement
date
has
at

given
mr

something
to
aim
for
even
if
the

it
has
been
my
privilege
to
have
worked
closely
with
him
closely
at
the
the
cause
of

for
many
years

it
is
fitting
that
in
this
year
of
challenge
and
opportunity
for
the
african

been
given
such
a
pivotal

i
am
honoured
to

especially
as
it
comes
at
such
an
integral
time
for
our
relationship
with
south
africa
and
the
african
and
opportunities
ahead
and
i
look
forward
to
embracing
them
with
great
anticipation
asked
if
he
was
appointed
as
the
result
of
a
fair
and
open
competition
he
replied
i
have
been
appointed
as
a
result
of
a
process
thats
been
used
before
by
labour
and
conservative
governments
to
appoint
people
of
all
parties
who
have
relevant
experience
mr

also
laughed
off
suggestions
that
his
reelection
in
brent
south
seat
had
been
in
danger
saying
it
was
one
of
the
safest
labour
seats
in

if
in

he
would
refuse
to
approve
either
mr

appointment
or
that
of
excabinet

by

that
the

labour
would
do
anything

what

that
he
is
trying

put
forward
to

also
the

what
we

really
poor
judgement
on
his

howard
said
tory
policies
on

were
striking
a
chord
with

told
the

playing

raising
the

said
his

plans
for
immigration
quotas
which
have
also
been
the
focus

not

just
common

rattled
by

faithful

in
applause
to

to
go
out

as
i
will
tell
mine
i
was
election
the
election
that
transformed
our
country
for
the
better
the
speech
which
was
peppered
with
references
to
mr
howards
humble
beginnings
as
the
child
of
immigrants
had
been
introduced
by
his
son
nick
a
trainee
vicar
who
praised
his
fathers
with
him

all
my
life
he
has
meant
what
he
has
said
to
me
he
stage
by
his

sandra
daughter
larissa
and
stepson
this
was
a
little
muted
by
party
conference
the
tories
have
labour
on
the
run
and
that
they
can
win
the
next
election
did
not
sound
quite
as
hollow
as
it
might
have
done
six
months
that
the
tories
campaign
has
got
off
to
a
great
back
foot
over
immigration
with
tony
blair
hastily
adding
a
sixth
promise
on
the
issue
to
his
latest
pledge
card
and
have
even
managed
to
score
points
in
traditional
labour
territory
such
as
health
and
her
postponed
operation
and
maria
hutchings
with
concerns
about
her
sons
special
needs
education
may
not
have
been
to
everyones
taste
but
they
succeeded
in
bringing
the
issues
alive
and
forcing
labour
to
long
last
starting
to
tap
into
the
public
mood
cutting
through
the
background
noise
to
connect
with
the
ordinary
a
range
of
policies
from
better
school
discipline
cleaner
hospitals
i
mean
how
hard
is
it
to
keep
a
hospital
clean
and
immigration
its
not
racist
to
impose
limits
on
immigration
under
the
headline
are
you
thinking
what
we
are
thinking
this
they
say
contrasts
with
labours
negative
campaigning
such
as
its
now
infamous
flying
pigs
lampooned
in
the
labour
poster
affects
bewilderment
at
what
he
believes
is
labours
loss
of
its
once
sure
footing
on
the
campaign
says
is
just
the
latest
example
of
the
party
getting
the
tone
wrong
a
byproduct
he
claims
of
the
tories
setting
the
understand
what
they
are
in
some
kind
of
state
of
shock
it
doesnt
seem
to
know
what
to
do
a
few
weeks
of
positive
headlines
have
also
done
wonders
for
tory
activists
morale
likely
to
be
a
crucial
factor
at
an
election
which
most
analysts
seem
to
agree
will
hinge
on
which
party
can
get
their
core
support
weeks
said
thisisanumber
politics
student
nick
the
media
and
there
is
a
sense
that
we
can
didnt
think
we
could
some
delegates
even
spoke
of
the
next
election
being
like
thisisanumber
when
ted
heath
behind
in
the

and
written
off
by
the
pundits
snatched
victory
from
harold
wilsons
labour
going
to
be
a
rerun
of
going
to
dent
that
massive
majority
but
it
just
didnt
happen
said
john

of
aldridge
browhills
the
top
has
got
it
bang
much
of
the
credit
for
the
tories
recent
change
of
fortune
must
go
to
lynton
crosby
the
australian
strategist
who
succeeded
in
turning
political
veteran
and
apparent
nohoper
john
howard
of
australias
liberal
party
into
a
serial
election
climb
if
michael
howard
is
to
walk
through
the
doors
of
number
against
the
tories
in
some
opinion
polls
they
are
still
behind
when
to
have
a
chance
of
overturning
labours
whopping
majority
they
should
really
be
the
start
of
the
campaign
proper
the
party
at
least
has
reason
to
hope
that
like
his
australian
namesake
mr
howard
really
isnt
finished
must
have
registered
by
thisisanumber
gmt
to
be
able
to
vote
in
the
general
election
if
it
is
held
as
expected
on
thisisanumber
autumn
should
already
be
on
the
register
but
those
who
have
moved
house
or
were
on
holiday
may
have
been
left
local

liam
fox
on
saturday
called
him
a
disappointment
of
historic
proportions
as
a
prime
from
a
series
of
at
times
tough
encounters
with
members
of
the
public
during
question
and
answer
sessions
across
the
country
in
recent
britains
growing
compensation
culture
which
has
brought
concerns
that
doctors
teachers
and
other
professionals
are
being
hampered
in
their
work
by
the
fear
of
frivolous
told
by
people
who
were
running
a
nursery
that
they
were
worried
about
letting
the
kids
out
into
the
playground
when
it
was
wet
in
case
one
of
them
slipped
and
fell
and
they
ended
up
having
a
legal
case
against
them

a
way
of
getting
people
protection
on
that
mr
blair
said
the
government
was
also
looking
at
how
to
make
sure
that
legal
aid
is
not
abused
with
actions
against
doctors
and
others
as
part
of
a
review
being
carried
out
by

about
the

posed

hundreds
sometimes
millions

a
small

after
