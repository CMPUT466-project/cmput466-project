the

not

so
that

at

if

it

greatest
in

said
the
world
could
never
repay
the
debt
of
gratitude
it
owed
to
smith
whose
genius
he
compared
to
that
of
towering
contributor
to
the
modern
adam

and
by
extension
of
modern
economics
is
also
of

where
your

was
what
extent
the
chancellors
renowned
economic
and
financial
skills
are
the
result
of
exposure
to
the
subliminal
intellectenhancing
emanation
in

he
continued
smith

far
beyond
the
insights
of
his

greenspan
said
smiths
revolutionary
philosophy
on
human
selfinterest
laissezfaire
economics
and
competition
had
been
a
force
for
good
in
the
of
intellectuals
of
the
enlightenment
especially
with
smith
toiling
in
the
environs
of
kirkcaldy
created
the
modern
vision
of
people
free
to
choose

it
is
very
fitting
that
the

this

this
