ensuring
the

is
a
crucial

growth
rate
explained
dr
for
the
whole

it
has
done
well
to
reach
whole
population
you
have
to
make
sure
it
can
scale
up
thisisanumber
the
standard
that
will
replace
the
existing
thisisanumber
will
allow
for
billions
more

it

gradually
being
worked
into

you

there

the

said
dr
complex
as
the

a
big
thisisanumber

he

that

the

thisisanumber
of

every

critical
to
what
they

is
information
they
simply

once

they

said
the

reflected
its

research
which
showed
that

use

the

the

gather

they

they

with
were
a
fair
and
unbiased
selection
of
the

on
a
topic
that
can
be
found
on
the

is
a
lack
of
awareness
about
paidfor
results
that
many
search

provide
alongside
lists

the
that
someone

the

they
see
when
they
carry
out
a
they
can
tell
which

are
paid
for
and
which
are
is
ironic
since
nearly
half
of
all

say
they
would
stop
using

if
they
thought

were
not

about
exploiting

who
have

who
often
see

so
on

he
also
be

former

bill
dutch

conclude
its

of
the

by
pushing
through
a
controversial
measure
that
has
been
rejected
by
the
european
parliament
lacks
majority
support
from
national
governments
and
will
leave
millions
of
european
citizens
in
legal
limbo
and
facing
the
possibility
of
court
cases
against
border
controls
defence
or
even
the
new
constitution
then
our
tv
screens
would
be
full
of
experts
agonising
over
the
impact
on
our
daily
directly
affected
the
controversy
concerns
the
patenting
of
computer
programs
a
topic
that
may
excite
the
bloggers
campaigning
groups
and
technical
press
but
does
not
obsess
middle
you
generate
about
the
directive
on
the
patentability
of
computerimplemented
inventions
and
the
way
it
amends
article
thisisanumber
of
the
thisisanumber
european
patent
convention
yet
if
the
new
directive
is
nodded
through
at
the
next
meeting
of
one
of
the
eus
ministerial
councils
as
seems
likely
it
will
allow
programs
to
be
patented
in
europe
just
as
they
are
in
the
including
myself
think
the
results
will
be
disastrous
for
small
companies
innovative
programmers
and
the
free
and
open
source
software
all
sorts
of
ideas
and
give
legal
force
to
those
who
want
to
limit
their
competitors
use
of
really
obvious
a
system
that
stores
customer
credit
card
details
so
that
they
can
pay
without
having
to
reenter
them
unless
amazon
lets
you
because
they
hold
the
patent
on
oneclick
online
amazon
made
it
to
the
patent
office
first
and
now
owns
sort
of
thing
over
here
but
perhaps
not
for
thisisanumber
although
argument
about
patentability
of
software
and
computerimplemented
inventions
has
been
going
on
since
at
least
the
now
after
a
year
in
which
proposals
were
made
endorsed
by
the
council
of
ministers
radically
modified
by
the
european
parliament
and
then
represented
in
their
original
aware
of
the
germanys
main
political
parties
have
opposed
it
but
there
is
not
enough
opposition
to
guarantee
their
held
a
consultation
meeting
with
those
who
had
commented
on
the
to
listen
and
outline
the
uk
position
but
according
to
those
present
it
was
embarrassing
to
see
how
little
the
minister
and
his
officials
actually
understood
the
issues
through
the
council
as
what
is
called
an
a
item
and
can
only
be
approved
or
first
there
is
the
abuse
of
the
democratic
process
involved
in
disregarding
the
views
of
the
parliament
and
abandoning
all
of
their
carefully
argued
the
european
project
and
even
those
who
do
not
care
about
software
or
patents
should
be
today
who
is
to
say
that
it
will
not
be
you
tomorrowmore
directly
once
software
patents
are
granted
then
any
programmer
will
have
to
worry
that
the
code
they
are
writing
is
infringing
someone
elses
as
code
is
already
protected
by
much
right
to
stop
anyone
else
using
their
invention
even
if
the
other
person
invented
it
managed
to
read
lord
byrons
childe
harolds
one
of
my
articles
contained
a
substantial
chunk
of
the
poem
then
i
could
defend
myself
in
court
by
claiming
that
i
had
simply
made
it
up
and
it
was
a
and
write
a
brilliant
graphics
compression
routine
and
it
happens
to
be
the
same
as
the
lzw
algorithm
used
in
gif
files
then
i
am
in
trouble
under
patent
law
at
least
in
the
many
of
the
major
software
companies
but
this
is
hardly
surprising
since
most
of
them
are
usbased
and
they
have
already
had
to
cope
with
a
legal
environment
that
allows
crucially
patents
of
their
own
which
they
can
trade
or
crosslicense
with
other
patent
course
as
microsoft
found
out
last
year
when
they
initially
lost
a
case
brought
by
eolas
which
claimed
that
internet
explorer
and
other
browsers
infringed
an
eolas
but
only
after
months
of
uncertainty
and
millions
of
and
open

not
have
any

to

use
every
day

like
the

the

who
do
not

to
check

overnight
of
has
to
be
written
into
national
laws
and
then
there
will
be
a
steady
stream
of
legal
actions
against
small
companies
and
open
source

directly
probably
with
some
secret
funding
from
one
or

at

youll
be
together

me
my
the
guilt
hehe
how
long
have
i
played
in
one
sitting
from
morning
till
the
early
hours
of
the
next
day
the
birds
were
singing
out
side
and
i
had
to
hobble
to
the
bath
room
cos
my
bladder
was
so
full
i
was
in
pain
i
would
hardly
eat
perhaps
some
toast
smoke
endlessly
and
off
and
i
have
a
girlfriend
but
still
no
give
me
an
adiction
to
illusory
achievement
and
as
there
is
no
end
in
sight
you
keep
going
for
the
mirage
of
the
cause
for
concern
but
it
always
bothers
me
when
articles
about
gaming
talk
in
terms
of
a
week
playing
everquest
has
a
do
with
a
dysfunctional
sense
of
consider
the
game
to
be
real
any
more
than
for
example
an
obsessive
automotive
tinkerer
considers
their
car
to
be
in
terms
of
encouraging
obsessive
behaviour
it
is
not
that
they
create
an
absorbing
virtual
world
but
rather
that
they
can
be
easily
accessed
with
the
nature
of
gaming
but
with
the
nature
of
modern
thisisanumber
hour
mmorpgs
is
that
you
can
never
really
complete
them
theres
always
another
quest
to
only
had
about
thisisanumber
hours
sleep
since
it
was
released
thisisanumber
on
a
sunday
paused
for
a
brief
sleep
at
thisisanumber
on
the
monday
and
after
visit
to
university
for
classes
restarted
at
about
midday
for
another
thisisanumber
hour
on
about
about
the
problems
of
hardcore
gaming
seem
to
be
those
who
have
rarely
allowed
themselves
to
become
immersed
in
a
change
if
they
were
to
do
addict
while
i
was
in
the
gaming
world
felt
more
real
than
the
real
and
was
able
to
barely
to
my
senses
when
i
did
others
were
less
fortunate
and
dropped
out
of
job
i
avoid
online
rpgs
like
the
told
my
partner
i
had
a
new
job
for
three
months
whilst
every
day
i
played
everquest
from
thisisanumber
till
i
had
just
got
in
as
well
hence
justifying
playing
it
all
and
have
a
good
where
i
was
eating
my
dinner
in
front
of
the
pc
i
realised
things
were
getting
silly
so
im
trying
not
to
spend
so
much
time
on
a
real
addiction
going
on
i
love
to
complete
a
it
i
am
finished
time
to
move
goal
so
from
that
standpoint
it
is
an
never
complete
an
ultimate
goal
well
it
would
be
like
falling
into
a
black
a
controlled
fantasy
world
than
face
reality
at
times
in
other
words
the
goal
offered
in
the
pc
game
are
easier
and
more
fun
than
the
real
about
as
it
would
destroy
my
marrage
i
just
know
iti
played
star
wars
galaxies
for
about
a
year
and
can
attest
to
the
addictiveness
of
these
a
way
that
early
on
in
the
game
you
progress
quickly
but
this
progress
becomes
exponentially
slower
requiring
more
and
more
time
to
reach
the
next
the
peak
of
my
addiction
i
was
spending
entire
weekends
in
front
of
my
monitor
slowly
building
up
my
character
stopping
only
for
food
and
toilet
and
actually
managed
to
sell
my
jedi
account
for
thisisanumber
which
is
my
only
sanity
check
in
an
otherwise
completely
unproductive
time
ultima
my
i
still
have
vivid
memories
of
the
experiences
and
friends
i
of
escapism
where
you
can
be
yourself
without
fear
of
the
thoughts
of
in
the
day
to
day
running
of
a
normal
giving
to
much
of
there
life
to
these
games
i
believe
they
are
a
better
way
to
spend
your
time
than
say
watching
made
a
recognised
to
play
upto
eight
hours
a
night
after
work
every
night
for
about
a
year
building
up
my
stats
completing
evermore
quests
and
battling
get
out
even
met
someone
and
got
married
has
my
life
changed
hell
no
i
still
cast
spells
and
battle
till
the
early
hours
of
the
be
enjoyed
just
as
much
as
you
would
enjoy
watching
television
or
going
to
the
cinema
or
the
pub
with
your
an
occasional
basis
and
are
able
to
lead
succesfull
lives
with
families
relationships
and
good
over
and
destroy
their
lives
and
become
is
true
of
clear
either
legalise
drugs
or
outlaw
online
gamingsounds
like
there
are
some
sad
stories
here
and
i
can
believe
them
and
know
full
well
how
addictive
it
not
take
over
my
do
not
know
how
to
draw
this
line
or
lack
the
willpower
to
stop
themselves
stepping
over
in
general
i
spend
far
too
much
time
playing
games
like
everquest
thisisanumber
and
football
manager
rather
than
going
out
and
interacting
with
real
people
and
when
i
do
try
to
im
always
thinking
in
the
back
if
my
mind
that
id
rather
be
in
front
of
the
computer
winning
the
league
with
cambridge
playing
it
has
the
adrenaline
of
a
real
life
situation
goals
to
achieve
day
online
playing
it
and
i
rarely
get
more
than
four
to
five
hours
sleep
before
getting
up
for
work
the
next
their
time
in
mmorpgs
rather
than
in
front
of
the
tv
i
fail
to
see
how
it
will
affect
players
social
lives
a
huge
social
aspect
whereas
other
games
and
some
other
pursuits
such
as
being
a
couch
potato
the
players
could
be
indulging
in
are
solitary
by
too
much
of
anything
is
a
bad
thing
but
as
long
as
you
can
walk
away
from
the
computer
to
do
other
things
too
they
can
be
great
they
have
lots
pc
bangs
internet
addicted
to
online
games
and
one
korean
died
because
of
the
lack
of
food
and
water
he
had
through
playing
online
rescheduling
everything
around
my
gaming
thisisanumber
hour
straight
long
but
its
an
obsession
that
i
cant
is
not
a
wind
for
an
hour
or
two
a
day
were
both
aware
of
how
much
time
can
disappear
by
sitting
in
front
of
a
tv
trying
to
frag
some
home
and
relasing
the
stress
of
a
day
by
an
hour
or
so
gaming
and
enjoying
real
world
of
warcraft
when
it
came
thisisanumber
hrs
a
month
because
it
was
so
addictive
but
have
subsequently
just
bought
the
european
version
couldnt
help
my
time
far
more
some
years
i
agree
that
these
type
of
games
can
be
life
younger
generation
of
gamers
that
play
for
hours
on
end
in
an
adult
credit
card
to
play
but
i
dont
think
parents
know
just
what
they
are
letting
there
children
that
staring
at
a
computer
screens
for
hours
at
a
time
can
damage
a
thisisanumber
health
you
can
expect
this
not
to
decline
but
to
get
machines
and
notice
that
our
world
is
being
swiftly
overcome
by
issues
and
troubles
that
make
the
trifling
worries
of
and
online
universe
absolutely
at
school
and
i
was
on
half
term
ultima
online
was
the
game
ahhhh
them
was
the
days
