the

it
initially
received
some
resistance
from

there
were

to
his

cherish
these

its
also
a

a

just
a

mr

wants
the

to
become
more

but
conceded
this
was
a
year
so
for
us
to
claim
were
going
to
make
thisisanumber
million
laptops
is
a
big
number
but
were
not
talking
about
doing
it
in
three
or
five
years
were
talking
about
months
he
plans
to
be
distributing
them
by
the

and
is
already
in
discussion
with
the
chinese
education
ministry
who
are
expected
to
make
a
large

per

on
so
if
we
can
distribute
and
sell
laptops
in
quantities
of
one
million
or
more
to

of

thats
cheaper

that

they

one
and
has

attention
have
been

they

that

mr

there

the
way
these

get

is
through

said
mr

whole
messy

if
you

already
got

in

you
will
have
them
tomorrow
and
if
you
dont
have
a

policy
now
you
had
better
start
looking

mr

theres
a
strong
social

too
older
mobile

are
proving
particularly
useful
in
poorer
nations
where
people
want
to
use

keep
in

with

do
not

took
an

look
at
romania
where
reconditioned
mobile

were
proving
very
has
a
really
crap
fixed
line
network
said
mr
goodman
and
theres
a
real
desire
for
people
to
get
mobile
phones
but
the
relatively
low
wages
in
romania
which
is
one
of
the
poorest
countries
in
europe
mean
few
people
can
afford
a
shiny
new
a
real
barrier
to
getting
one
he

as
the
report
revealed
that
almost
onethird
of

were

the

that
when

but
this
is
down
from
a
peak
of
almost
thisisanumber
in

revealed
that
many
britons
are
unhappy
with
their

high

and
the

service
they
and
a
further
thisisanumber
are
considering
changing

the

with
almost
three
times
as
many

trying

interviewed
were
fed
up
with

but
this
could
be
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
thinks
tim

in
more
and
more
people
are
trying

switch
he
tiscali
have
been
actively
dissuading
customers
from
leaving
by
offering
them
a
lower
price
when
they
phone
up
to
cancel
their

just
thisisanumber
more
expensive
than
that
offered
by
an
alternative
operator
making
it
hardly
worth
while
providers
are
desperate
to
hold
on
to
unable
to
swap
at
problems
but
one
of
the
biggest
issues
is
the
current
supplier
withholding
the
information
that
people
need
to
give
to
their
new
supplier
said
tim
danton
editor
of

but
because
that
code
is
voluntary
theres
nothing
we
or
ofcom
can
do
to
help
he
internet

providers
in
the
uk
now
and
an
often
bewildering
array
of
broadband
further
in
coming
months
mr
danton
advises
everyone
to
shop
around
current

then
theres
every
chance
youre
being
ripped
off

which
will
allow
customers
requiring
huge

to
rent
it
by

he
asked

launching
suns
quarterly
network
computing

in

centre
managers
to
adopt
a
new

but
it
said
it
already

it
already
has
a

argues
that
its

is
cheaper
than
that
offered

to
help
it
overcome
the

of
setting

in

make
the

offices
and
its

up
to

can
be
set
up
much
faster
than

helped
the
firm
set
up
networks
in
more
than
thisisanumber
to
dig
the
ground
and
lay
the
pipes
is
a
bit
of
a
task
said
mr
the
ground
mean
that
digging
is
uniquely
difficult
he
to
dig
up
roads
and
lay
cables
was
impossible
to
to
secure
permission
for
putting
networking
hardware
on

to
equipment
that
uses
lasers
to
make
the
final
mile
leap
between
tatas

up
to
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
times
faster
than
a
thisisanumber
broadband
connection
but
tata
is
running
its
hardware
at
more
modest

of
india
because
of
its

is
a
little
low

its
hardly

he
and
fog
is
common
laser
links
can
struggle
to
maintain
good

less
time
to
set
up
and
get
working
said
mr
normal
time
period
for
set
up
is
a
few
hours
he
roads
and
laying

can
take
weeks
or
helped
tata

so
we
need
ordinary
people
people
with
interesting
faces
she
added
not
everyone
is
a
model
in
the
world
so
we
dont
want
just
models
in
our
games
people
chosen
to
appear
in
a
game
will
have
their

scanned
in
three

taken
so
that
a

the

its
really
quite
incredible
how

they
are
said
ms
no
control
over
how
the

he
thinks

makes

who
had
never

now
the

and
the

skinny
it
down
you
can

the

recognised
that

now
widely
seen
as
predicting
the
digital
in
the

state
of
maine
where
children
were
given
laptop
computers
to
take
home
and
do
their
work
the
children
it
initially
received
some
resistance
from
the
teachers
and
there
were
problems
with
laptops
getting
idea
to
his
own
work
in
cambodia
where
he
set
up
two
schools
together
with
his
wife
and
gave
the
children
years
ago
only
one
has
been
broken
the
kids
cherish
these
things
its
also
a
tv
a
telephone
and
a
games
machine
not
just
a
textbook
mr
negroponte
wants
the
laptops
to
become
more
common
than
mobile
phones
but
conceded
this
was
a
year
so
for
us
to
claim
were
going
to
make
thisisanumber
million
laptops
is
a
big
number
but
were
not
talking
about
doing
it
in
three
or
five
years
were
talking
about
months
he
plans
to
be
distributing
them
by
the
end
of
thisisanumber
and
is
already
in
discussion
with
the
chinese
education
ministry
who
are
expected
to
make
a
large
child
per
year
on
so
if
we
can
distribute
and
sell
laptops
in
quantities
of
one
million
or
more
to
ministries
of
education
thats
cheaper
and
the
marketing
overheads
go
boom

in

according
to
research
from

analysts

last
year
globally
said
the

the
highest
total

surpassed
even
the
most
optimistic
predictions
gartner

there
was

shows
that

are
continuing
in

mobile

told
the

western
european
markets
can
be
in
a
couple
of
years
cameras
and
all
that
we
can
think
of
on
mobiles
so
people
have
stopped
buying
replacement
phonesbut
there
could
be
a
slight
slowdown
in
sales
in
european
and
us
markets
too
according
to
gartner
as
people
wait
to
see
what
comes
next
in
mobile
think
carefully
about
what
they
are
offering
in
new
models
so
that
people
see
a
compelling
reason
to
upgrade
said
ability
to
handle
large
amounts
of
data
transfer
like
video
could
drive
people
into
upgrading
their
phones
but
ms
milanesi
said
it
was
difficult
to
say
how
quickly
that
would
people
have
cameras
and
colour
screens
on
mobiles
and
for
the
majority
of
people
out
there
who
dont
really
care
about
technology
the
speed
of
data
to
a
phone
is
not
critical
nor
would
the
rush
to
produce
two
or
three
megapixel
camera
phones
be
a
reason
for
mobile
owners
to
upgrade
on
its
are
not
at
the
stage
where
they
can
compete
with
digital
cameras
which
also
have
flashes
and
thisisanumber
would
be
the
attention
to
design
and
aesthetics
as
well
as
music
typical
of
the
attention
to
design
that
would
be
more
commonplace
in
thisisanumber
she
she
said
but
a
desire
from
men
and
women
to
have
a
gadget
that
is
a
form
of
selfexpression
the
phone
functioned
but
about
what
it
said
about
its
market
which
is
quite
attentive
to

together
with
that
there

the

started
using

tactic
to
squeeze
more

out

to
give

several

they

these

were
not
being

transparently
said
mr
being
offered
a

service
we
saw
potential
for
substantial
consumer
harm
here
he
led
to
the
creation
of
a
new
code
of

for
firms
that
want
to
sell

was
led
by

this
code

said
andrew

firm
they
have
got
themselves
into

how

the
consumer
has
a
right
to
be
protected
he
content
firm
zed
said
the
new
system
was
essential
if
consumers
were
to
trust
companies
that
sell
ringtones
and
other
the
whole
industry
and
if
thats
done
effectively
we
will
see
the
cowboys
driven
out
he
force
on
thisisanumber
january
and
the
first
month
under
the
new
regime
has
seen
many
firms
cautioned
for
not
honouring
websites
so
customers
know
what
they
get
for
their
money
and
what
they
are
signing
up
for
said
mr
briefly
cut
off
between
eight

ten

sellers
flouting
the
firms
he
under
the
rules
consumers
must
be
able
to
switch
off
the

by
using
a
universal
stop
command
sent
via

designed
to
limit
how
much
a

will
pay
if
they
inadvertently
signed

for
a
people
really
resent
the
abuse
of
what
is
effectively
part
of
their
personality
said
mr
behind
the
first
macintosh
computer
has
first
employees
at
apple
and
made
many
of
the
design
decisions
that
made
the
mac
so
distinctive
when
it
was
first
to
use
a
graphical
interface
and

that
let
people
navigate
around

up
to
his
idea
of
a
machine
that
was
cheap
aimed
at
consumers
rather
than
computer
professionals
and
was
very
easy
to
that
did
away
with
the
then
common
textbased
interface
in
favour
of
one
based
around
graphics
that
resembled
a

used

the

that

odd
mix

suggests
a

research

reveals
that
thisisanumber
of

usually
find
what
they
were
looking
for
when
using

the
difference
between

users
say
they
regularly
use

when
they

for

out
a

at

and
thisisanumber
of
those
asked
only
look
every

information
they
are

is
critical
to
what
they
are
doing
and
is
information
they
simply
have
to
be
very
loyal
and
once
they

they

they

said
the

reflected
its
own
research
which
showed
that
people
use
different

because
the
way
the

gather
information
means
they
can
provide
different

for
the

half
of

thisisanumber

they

that
the

they
were

with
were
a
fair
and
unbiased
selection
of
the
information
on
a
topic
that
can
be
found
on
the
users
is
a
lack
of
awareness
about
paidfor
results
that
many
search
engines
provide
alongside
lists
of
websites
found
by

the
that
someone
has
paid
for
some
of
the
results
they
see
when
they
carry
out
a
they
can
tell
which
results
are
paid
for
and
which
are
is
ironic
since
nearly
half
of
all
users
say
they
would
stop
using
search
engines
if
they
thought
engines
were
not
being
clear
about
how
they
presented
paid
results
commenting
mr

must
be
clearly
marked

they

lets
thisisanumber
offer

deals
on

that

probably
have
to

that

challenge

wimax

steal

said
the

offered
by

could
dent
the
possible
returns
of
thisisanumber
must
not
be
forgotten
more

its
wider

is
only
held
back
by

differences
across

look
set

to
roll
out

project
during

device
that
uses
the
mobile

when
you
are
out
and
about
but
switches
back
to
the
fixed
line
when
you
are
at
to
get
much
more
serious
competition
from
a
technology
that
has
the
formidable
name
of

coming
from
the

digital

that
we
take

you
also
take

there
is
such
a

say
the

some
changes
for

it

for

someone
has
to

is
that
they
are
going

put
a

more

it
could
be
more
expensive
because
of
all
the

if

in

seven
years
at

theres
something
on

ive
got
to
go
find
it
and
ill
see
you
laterbut
mr
currys
technology
and
broadcast
interests
started
to
gel
a
couple
of
years
ago
when
computer
storage
was
growing
exponentially
and
highspeed
internet
connections
were
becoming
more
widely
people
could
create
and
upload
audio
more
cheaply
and
efficiently
than
ever
across
the
globe
were
bored
with
the
radio
they
were
that
you
hear
today
its
radio
voices
and
its
fake
its
just
fake
he
wanted
to
make
it
easier
for
people
to
find
real
voices
on
the
download
new
audio
content
directly
onto
players
like
programmer
so
he
asked
others
to
create
one
for
to
write
one
ago
and
says
it
totally
sucked
he
put
it
up
on
the
net
as
open
source
software
and
now
dozens
of
coders
and
audio
junkies
are
refining
it
the
result
is
a
work
in
progress
called
the
former
mtv
vj
for
what
he
has
solved
what
we
call
the
last
mile
and
brings
it
all
the
way
down
to
the
thisisanumber
player
he
morning
pick
up
their
ipods
as
they
go
to
work
or
before
they
go
exercise
and
discover
that
theres
all
this
new
content
automatically
put
onto
their

it
is
created
an
explosion
in
podcasting
content
and
podcasters
are
springing
up
in
australia
finland
brazil
even
and
drew

from
wisconsin
in

sometimes
even
from
the

air
their

too

may
turn
what
they
see
as
the
antiradio
into
something
that
is
more
like
conventional
from

and
so
is
ahead
with
his

the

would
radically
alter
the
role

influence
what
they
see

hear
according
to
their
personal
tastes
and
wishes
he
passive

but
become
active

it
will
also
be
important
that
the

are
sophisticated
enough
to

mr

fit
together
both
visually
by
observing
the
timehonoured
rules
that
go
in
editing
and
in
terms
of
the
story
only
then
will
the
personalised
version
both
make
sense
and
be

pleasing

more

present

trend
micro
said
the
move
to
windows
in
cash
machines
was
not
without
towergroup
showed
that
thisisanumber
of
new
cash
machines
being
installed
were
windows
four
incidents
in
which
cash

have
been
unavailable
for
hours
due
to
viruses
affecting
the

of
the

many
of

of
cash
machines
of
two
unnamed
banks
were
put
out
of
action
for
hours
following
an
infection
by
the
welchia
thiemann
because
when
banks
start
using
windows
cash
machines
they
also
change
the

technology
used

link
the

to

caught
up
in
the

that
are
going
around

they
have
a

system
he
part
of
the
investment
to
maintain
the
security
of
that
network
mr
thiemann
told
bbc
news
research
said
the
number
of
cash
machines
actually
at
risk
was
low
because
so
few
were
upgraded
every
has
a
lifetime
of
up
to
thisisanumber
years
which
means
that
only
about
thisisanumber
of
all
atms
get
swapped
for
a
newer
model
every
for
several
years
he
of
their
usual
replacement
cycle
in
theory
there
is
a
bigger
threat
with
windows
than
thisisanumber
he
said
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
banks
are
hugely
concerned
at
the
moment
its
pretty
unusual
to
hear
about
virus
problems
with
atms
he
to
cash
machines
meant
there
was
no
chance
that
a
virus
could
cause
them
to
start
spitting
out
cash
spontaneously
he
worried
about
internal
networks
being
overwhelmed
by
worms
and
viruses
and
customers
not
being

to
get

out
at
all

said
the
risk
from

was
to
be

hitting
the

networks
he
the

networks
that
connect

the

by

they

just
not
going

able

as
these
things
did
these
are
not
altogether
new
ideas
and
academics
have
been
exploring
how
technologies
impact
wider
society
for
companies
is
that
a
new
idea
method
or
device
will
have
to
have
a
different
kind
thinking
behind
it
so
that
people
see
the
value
that

has
for
now
when
it
comes
to

argues
mr

industry
weeks
thisisanumber
technology
leader
of

now

have
to
demonstrate
that

work
make

gets
better

it
was
cool

change

innovation
in

that
people
will
see
affecting
their

he
says
will
come
about
slowly

and
in
ways
that

no

be

in

of

through

in

into

where

become

that

taken
for

just
there
like

says
mr
to

in
ways
people
will
not
know
natural

will
develop

will
shape
your

and
our
technologically

be
telling

mr
perform

integral
to

added
that
the

bluray

the

it

added
the

on

which
involves
creating

and
increasing
the

increasing
the

all
of
these
are
part
of
getting
a

fitting
these

compressing

the

that
bittorrent
is
called

that
point

to

happy
to

the

they
are
looking
crippled
the

by
the
legal

was
suprnovaorg
which
helped
boost
the

of
the

by
checking
that

sloncek
is
preparing

sloncek
said
exeem
would
combine
ideas
from

be
able

rate

stop
the
spread
of
fake

sloncek
told
the
delft
university
of

who
studies
peertopeer
networks
said
exeem
was
the
next
evolution
in
filesharing
to
be
as
popular
as
bittorrent
and
suprnova
because
early
versions
were
not
taking
enough
care
to
make
sure
good
copies
of
files
were
being
flawed
because
it
is
easy
to
insert
both
fake
files
and
fake
ratings
he
for
record
labels
and
movie
studios
have
worked
to
undermine
kazaa
by
putting
in
sure
files
being
shared
were
high
having
a
system
that
works
and
one
thats
full
of
crap
like
kazaa
he
distribution
and
integrity
he
of
filesharing
systems
are
likely
to
incorporate
some
kind
of
distributed
reputation
system
that
lets
moderators
prove
who
they
are
to
the
network
and
rate
which
files
are
worth
moderation
systems
were
key
said
mr

had
driven
people
away
from

such
as

simply
migrated

a

also
because

it

easy
to
get

with
an

or
get
a

in
someone
elses
matter
to
move
the

into

and
leave
the
unwitting
victim
to
sort
out
the
mess
when
statements
and
demands
for

start
economic
crime
and
we
are
all
becoming

aware

the

you
trust
with

properly
then
you
are
in
taken
the

so
long
to
realise
that
a
wellplaced
insider
is
by
far
the
simplest
way
to
break
the
security
of
a
computer
fsa
is
probably
very
late
to
this
particular
party
and
that
this
sort
of
thing
has
been
going
on
for
rather
a
long
links
to
the
criminal
underworld
i
wonder
and
it
is
hardly
likely
to
be
only
banks
that
are
being
course
the
big
ecommerce
sites
like

also
offer
rich
pickings
for
the

likely
to
catch
out
those
who
access
account
details
that
they
are
not
supposed
of
the
danger
of
identity
theft
and
look
more
carefully
for
unexpected
transactions
on
our
statements
banks
should
have
good
enough
records
and
logs
to
trace
the
people
who
might
have
accessed
the
account
keep
bank
systems
more
secure
from
the
sort
of

that
involves
taking

into

plugging
it
into

and
sucking
down

of

just
to
authorised

or
even
to
an
individuals
personal
memory
it
does
not
feel
like
a
wave
of
fraud
is
about
to
wash
away
the
entire
financial
of
the
major
issues
with
ecommerce
and
online
trading
the
security
or
otherwise
of
the
servers
and
other
systems
that
make
up
the
back
that
the
real
danger
in
paying
for
goods
online
with
a
credit
card
is
not
that
the
number
will
be
intercepted
in
transit
but
that
the
shop
you
are
dealing
with
will
be
of
a
single
case
where
an
email
containing
payment
details
has
led
to
card
passing
over
the
net
for
interception
to
be
a
sensible
tool
for
anyone
out
to
commit
companies
have
left
their
databases
open
and
suffered
the
bank
cahoot
admitted
that
its
customer
account
details
could
be
read
by
anyone
who
could
guess
a
login
in
because
of
poor
system
security
or
internal
staff
abusing
the
access
they
get
as
part
of
their
job
the
issue
is
the
same
how
do
we
make
sure
that
our
personal
data
is
not
abused
any
organisation
that
processes
personal
data
is
of
course
bound
by
the
data
protection
act
and
must
take
proper
care
of
the
penalties
are
small
and
the
process
of
prosecuting
under
the
act
so
convoluted
as
to
be
worthless
in
just
leave
it
to
the
stolen
are
too
serious
and
markets
respond
too
but
it
would
be
so
much
hassle
to
move
my
accounts
that
i
did
not
even
consider
it
when
i
heard
about
their
security
their
accounts
especially
when
there
is
little
guarantee
that
other
banks
are
not
going
to
make
the
same
sort
of
mistake
in
be
more
stringent
data
protection
law
so
that
companies
really
feel
the
pressure
to
improve
their
internal
processes
or
a

of
civil
lawsuits
against
financial

with
sloppy

whose
customers
suffer

asked

british
thisisanumber
consumers

that

thisisanumber

this

growth
said
thisisanumber
but
the
portable

has
been
growing
steadily
since
the
launch

in

of
highcapacity

that
let
them
store
every

on

that
they
broadband
is
a
central
part
of
daily
life
at
least
for
some
argues
technology
analyst
bill
being
a
writer
is
that
i
rarely
have
to
go
to
an
office
to
or
a
library
with
or
without
a
wifi
connection
and
research
and
write
cross
station
on
my
way
to
a
meeting
then
i
can
log
on
from
the
working
with
my
girlfriend
anne
a
childrens
writer
at
her
house
in
cambridge
sharing
her
wireless
i
arrived
at
her
house
to
find
that
there
was
no
network
noticed
that
it
had
no
power
and
when
she
changed
the
power
lead
it
sparked
at
her
in
a
way
which
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
it
was
never
going
to
talk
to
the
internet
they
told
her
it
would
be
five
days
before
an
engineer
would
show
up
with
a
new
cable
but
in
fact
she
really
suffered
until
her
connection
was
restored
on
computer
she
had
to
borrow
internet
access
from
friends
or
use
the
dialup
connection
on
her
daughters
laptop
so
she
had
to
choose
between
copying
her
files
onto
her
usb
memory
card
or
accepting
a
slower
and
flakier
net
submit
the
pictures
she
wanted
to
use
for
a
book
on
earthquakes
because
they
were
too
big
to
send
over
because
she
is
used
to
having
easy
access
to
a
fast
link
that
lets
her
search
quickly
and
personal
life
to
the
cinema
during
halfterm
because
she
could
not
find
out
which
films
were
showing
at
the
local
but
did
not
check
the
weather
because
the
only
place
she
knows
to
look
for
weather
information
is
the
bbc
to
go
fossilhunting
on
the
trip
because
she
could
not
type
fossils
norfolk
into
could
have
answered
these
questions
if
she
had
looked
in
the
local
paper
listened
to
the
radio
or
found
a
book
on
fast
always
on
and
easy
access
to
the
net
has
become
part
of
the
routine
of
her
daily
life
and
when
it
was
taken
away
it
was
too
much
effort
to
go
back
to
the
old
ways
of
doing
do
not

anne
is
four

broadband

in

in

thisisanumber
and
numbers
are
climbing
by
the
end
of

earlier
this

new

users
are
selecting
broadband
from
the
users
are
beginning
to
mould
their
daily
lives
around
the
availability
of
broadband
internet
connections
and
they
too
will
find
it
difficult
to
cope
if
they
cannot
get
online
for
any
of
adaptation
and
it
is
a
vital
step
in
the
growth
of
broadband
in
the
uk
and
into
their
daily
lives
tell
their
friends
about
it
and
show
off
the
cool
stuff
they
can
broadband
so
that
they
can
share
digital
photos
and
do
all
of
the
other
things
that
need
fast

laughably

rather

are

when
it
comes
to
checking

for

at

at

the

is
confident
it
will

as
claimed
the

ships
with

plays
smoothly
even
with
a

of
using
the

to
navigate

while
the
bottom
screen
offers
a
topdown
map
and
the
ability
to
switch
method
and
while
it
makes
aiming
more
controlled
it
can
be
a
little
faithful
recreation
of
the
nintendo
thisisanumber
classic
with
a
host
of
new
minigames
and
new
portable
machine
and
the
sound
too
is
impressive
for
such
a
small
to
adapt
to
a
new
way
of
playing
while
it
could
prove
to
be
an
accessible
way
in

ultimately
the
success
or
failure
of
the

lies
in
the
hands

a

it

of

usual
diatribes
against
poor

badly

and
inadequate
disaster
recovery
yet
been
told
it
seems
that
the
problem
started
when
a
plan
to
upgrade
some
of
the
computers
from
windows
thisisanumber
to
windows
xp
went
wrong
and
xp
code
was
inadvertently
copied
to
thousands
of

across
the
have
a
lot
of
sympathy
for
the
network
managers
and

staff
and
occasionally
also
gives
us
a
degree
of
instability
and
unpredictability
that
we
cannot
design
out
of
the
godels
theorem
any
system
sufficiently
complex
to
be
useful
is
also
able
to
collapse
the
technology
aspects
until
we
all
know
what
actually
happened
and
whether
it
was
a
consequence
of
software
failure
or
just
bad
be
excused
is
the
fact
that
it
took
four
days
for
news
of
this
systems
failure
to
leak
out
into
the
technical
major
story
and
was
the
second
or
third
lead
item
on
bbc

thisisanumber
today
programme
throughout
friday
ministers
official
spokesman
mention
it
at
any

before

why
was
not
the
pensions
minister
in
parliament
to
make
an
emergency
statement
on
tuesday
when
it
was
clear
that
there
was
a
serious
problem
if
there
had
been
an
outbreak
of
legionnaires
disease
in
the
air
conditioning
system
we
would
have
been
told
but
it
seems
that
major
technology
problems
do
not
merit
the
same
doubt
be
looking
for
technical
lessons
to
learn
from
their
week
of
pain
we
can
learn
some
political
lessons
in
this
digital
world
technology
failures
are
matters
of
public
interest
not
something
that
can
be
ignored
in
the
hope
that
nobody
will
notice
care
or
report
on
what
went
wrong
and
what
was
done
to
fix
of
the
parties
involved
to
hide
behind
commercial
confidentiality
or
even
parliamentary
and
we
need
to
know
what
went

and
what
is
being
done
public
on
the

go
to
warn

about

they

icstis

they

unusually
high
companies
should
get
in

with
their
customers
usual
thisisanumber
a

i
want
to
know
about
it
straight
away
i
dont
want
to
be
told
when
its
hit
thisisanumber
companies
had
the
systems
in
place
to
spot
fraudulent
activity
and
artificiallyinflated
traffic
he
that
we
have
under
investigation
and
they
should
be
looking
out
for
these
numbers
he
i
would
not
be
surprised
to
find
my
credit
card
company
phoning
me
if
i
do
something
out
of
the
to
be
looking
to
see
if
they
can
have
a
similar
approach
the
biggest
phone
company
bt
says
it
is
doing
what
it
can
to
monitor
fraud
and
warn
people
about
rogue
use
call
barring
if
they
want
to
prevent
calls
to
premium
lines
because
under
the
current
system
once
the
call
has
been
made
theres
little
that
can
be
bt
consumer
said
we
do
look
at
customers
calling
patterns
and
we
do
make
interventions
when
they
are
out
of
the
whether
we
can
improve
this
but
as
bt
handled
thisisanumber
million
calls
a
day
monitoring
was
quite
a
task
in
itself
he
of
premium
line
services
and
is
likely
to
say
icstis
should
have
more
power
to
deal
with
rogue
diallers
in
payouts
on
the
behalf
of
customer
it
can
only
close
illegal
services
and
free
firewall
protection
unauthorised
access
and
outgoing
calls
inadvertently
and
innocently
caused
by
my
daughters
love
of
music
of
such
facilities
the
responsibility
clearly
falls
with
the
customer
but
many
fall
prey
through
simply
not
knowing
how
to
avoid
these
an
expensive
once
this
fraud
has
been
committed
and
recognised
the
phone
companies
pay
the
people
who
obtaining

fraudulently
so
are
these
people
followed
up
and
prosecuted
these
diallers
are
mainly
downloaded
from
sites
offering
illegal
thisisanumber
porn
and
pirated
theyd
be
considerably
less
at
seems
everyone
has
to
be
a
victim
these
dayspart
of
the
blame
has
to
rest
with
the
manufacturers
of
home
computer
operating
a
web
page
or
email
to
download
and
install
anything
without
the

companies
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
over
to
the
good

that
it
is
in
their

to
keep
the
scam
goingwhy
dont
bt
et

block
all
premium

by

and
only
turn
it
off
at
the

request
to
anyone
who
falls
foul
of
this
scam
refuse
to
pay
your
telephone
provider
for
these
of
these
fraudulent
transactions
they
cannot
insist
on
you
paying
the
knowingly
assist
the
fraudsters
to
commit
the
to
court
for
refusing
to
pay
these
use
broadband
instead
then
you
have
nothing
to
worry
and
the
freezing
cold
without
a
coat
you
would
not
drive
your
car
without
any
insurance
so
why
not
protect
your
pc
stop
blaming
the
phone
companies
its
not
their
faulti
was
very
impressed
with
our
phone
company
number
for
kylie
tickets
and
next
day
they
rang
back
to
ask
if
i
was
aware
there
were
thisisanumber
calls
to
the
same
welli
have
a
colleague
who
has
fallen
victim
to
this
kind
of
it
they
subsequently
put
a
block
on
premium
rate
of
over
thisisanumber
came
in
the
block
apparently
didnt
work
and
he
still
has
to
pay
for
it
even
though
a
block
was
in
for
their
customers
to
be
hit
with
a
huge
bill
otherwise
theyd
be
taking
extra
steps
to
prevent
this
kind
of
this
and
to
add
insult
to
injury
i
was
charged
vat
by
the
to
various
scams
ever
since
they
were
set
up
a
premium
rate
number
and
then
dial
it
day
and
night
from
phones
whose
quarterly
bills
were
never
here
and
you
can
bet
that
loophole
was
blocked
very
up
large
bills
despite
being
i
believe
that
they
will
shortly
be
giving
out
a
free
application
that
can
stop
you
dialling
expensive
numbers
without
companies
and
at
last
they
are
doing
something
about
by
the
legitimate
phone
companies
came
to
an
end
mainly
by
doing
away
with
dialup
altogether
and
bring
broadband
down
to
the
same
price
as
dialup
not
only
will
this
ruin
things
for
the
dialler
scammers
but
also
allow
people
to
update
and
upgrade
their
security
more
easily
and
roguedialling
scam
but
i
think
youre
seriously
remiss
in
not
pointing
out
that
the
vast
majority
of
these
scams
arise
from
people
trying
to
access
services
purporting
to
provide
free
entirely
at
fault
which
is
probably
why
the
telephone
companies
are
rightly
unwilling
to
refund
me
that
my
monthly
bill
had
risen
from
its
normal
thisisanumber
to
thisisanumber
to
above
having
over
thisisanumber
stolen
is
that
the
supplier
and
the
government
through
vat
are
profiting
from
this
crime
and
will
not
reimburse
me
their
portion
of
my
of
say
thisisanumber
on
premium
rate
calls
that
you
would
have
to
contact
your
provider
to
have
lifted
that
way
you
could
use
legitimate
premium
rate
numbers
while
limiting
fraudulent
be
limited
far
easier
for
a
telecoms
operator
to
write
off
thisisanumber
than
it
is
also
the
target
of
such
scams
but
thank
god
i
have
already
upgraded
to
broadband
and
nothing
was
connected
to
my
modem
so
all
i
heard
was
the
sound
of
an
attempted
responsibility
and
ensure
their
antivirus
and
firewall

is
up
to

that
should
prevent

now
we
are
going

higher

in
diversity
and
in
a
way
that
might
have
a
policy
implication
like
a
prelegislation
discussionthe
idea
of
a
civic
commons
was
originally
proposed
by
stephen
coleman
professor
of
edemocracy
at
the
oxford
internet
small
scale
examples
of
such
commons
that
already
the
bbcs
ican
project
which
connects
people
locally
and
nationally
who
want
to
take
action
around
important
a
bigger
role
in
setting
up
systems
of
trust
for
online
communities
could
also
be
widened
to
see
if
they
could
be
used
a
secure
authentication
system
which
could
have
value
for
peertopeer
interaction
presented
as
a
way
for
government
to
keep
tabs
on
people
and
ensuring
access
to
public
services
said
mr
is
how
authentication
technology
may
potentially
play
a
role
in
decentralised
online
communities
the
key
idea
to
take
from
systems
such
as
ebay
and
other
online
communities
is
letting
members
rate
each
others
reputation
by
how
they
treat
other
cooperation
between
members
of
virtual
and
physical
communities
could
be
would
work
within
a
nonmarket
system
which
lets
people
who
may
disagree
with
one
another
interact
within
publiclyrecognised
have
very
much
been
about
putting
basic
information
and
service
guides
online
as
well
as
letting
people
interact
with
government
via
the
mailing
lists
community
portals
message
boards
and
weblogs
often
form
around
common
interests
or
with
access
to
the
net
the
government
suggests
mr
davies
could
act
as
an
intermediary
or
middleman
to
set
up
public
online
places
of
debate
and
exchange
to
encourage
more
cosmopolitan
politics
and
public
trust
in
in
helping
citizens
trade
with
each
other
role
in
helping
citizens
connect
to
one
another
in
civic
nonmarket
interactions
said
mr
bodies
like
the
bbc
libraries
and

to
bring

back
into

never

i
realised
i
was
missing
the

overall

that
is
largely
due
to
the
poor

the

layout
the

good

was
intrigued
to
discover
that
i
had
nearly
missed
the
next
stage
of

and
indeed
anyone
of
my
generation
with
failing
eyesight
and
the
view
that
theres
never
anything
worth
watching
on

is
hardly
going
to
embrace
these

was
the
killer
application
that
drove

music

are
going
to
drive
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
service
and
thisisanumber
already
established
in
the
uk
video
on

is
clearly
going
to
become
a
musthave
for
kids
sitting
on
the
school
bus
adults
waiting
outside
clubs
and
anyone
who
has
time
to
kill
and
a

of
friends
to
who
are
looking
for
some
revenue
from
their
expensively
acquired
thisisanumber
playing
music
videos
on
a

marks
the
beginning
of
a
move
away
from
the
download
and
play
model
we
have
all
accepted
for
our
ipods
and
thisisanumber
to
carry
thisisanumber
of
music
and
pictures
around
with
me
in
my
pocket
when
i
can
simply
listen
to
anything
i
want
whenever
i
want
streamed
to
my
phone
oh
and
of
course
you
can
always
use
the
phone
to
make
voice
calls
and
send
texts
something
which
ensures
that
it
is
always
in
someones
pocket
or
handbag
available
for
other
uses
using
the
internet
protocol
ip
to
do
either
audio
or
video
streaming
and
i
think
that
technically
it
is
a
disaster
to
make
phone
calls
over
the
net
using
voice
over
the
net
at

up

to
give

cheap
access
to
the
spent
the
bulk
of
his
professional
career
trying
to
find
ways
to
make
technology
accessible
to
poor
out
why
poor
people
would
want
a
personal
computer
and
professor
reddy
thinks
he
has
a
pretty
good
idea
of
why
they
prof
reddy
i
know
what
the
population
is
like
many
of
them
are
illiterate
and
many
of
them
have
other
concerns
there
nobody
will
use
it
for
the
conventional
uses
of
a
pc
word
processing
and
powerpoint
he
if
people
wanted
to
use
pcs
in
a
village
it
has
to
usable
by
illiterate
people
and
it
must
be
primarily
for
entertainment
education
telemedicine
and
access
to
expert
adviceprof
reddy
also
thinks
that
tying
it
into
some
kind
of
aid
package
was
the
wrong
group
could
possibly
give
expensive
computers
to
thisisanumber
million
less
fortunate
indians
let
alone
the
billions
of
poor
people
around
the
worldinstead
prof
reddy
decided
to
think
of
those
thisisanumber
million
indians
as
a
potential
making
the
product
compelling
you
would
give
up
your
third
meal
in
order
to
have
this
prof
reddy
many
other
countries
they
will
first
go
get
a
television
set
before
they
worry
about
one
more
very
important
this
hatched
a
completely
new
personal
computer
television
and
telephone
all
in
one
that
runs
on
a
normal
desktop
applications
with
a
keyboard
and
mouse
but
illiterate
users
can
use
what
looks
like
a
television
remote
designate
applications
like
tv
voice
mail
and
video
audio
means
that
a
computer
for
an
illiterate
person
needs
thisisanumber
times
more
power
and
more
memory
than
one
for
a
graduate
students
says
that
when
youre
talking
illiterate
youre
talking
audio
and
video
and
that
demands
exponentially
high
bandwidth
it
cant
choke
at
any
point
in
time
and
it
has
to
withstand
anything
no
matter
what
youre
pressing
the
major
part
is
making
it
foolproof
very
tough
so
that
it
never
breaks
he
project
is
only
possible
because
pcs
are
now
so
much
cheaper
and
have
builtin
audio
and
video
hardware
and
due
to
start
this
month
in
the
indian
state
of
andhra
good

but
work
has
to
be
done
to
ensure
reliable
connections

the
eric
brewer
at
the
university
of
california
at
see
in
starbucks
or
many
other
hotspots
he
on

wireless
and
how
to
make
the
network
work
better
in
the
presence
of
intermittency
when
the
power
goes
up
and
down
and
the
links
go
up
and
down
and
the
computers
youre
connected
to
just
get
turned
off
for
no
reason
prof
reddy
says
he
hopes
to
lease
the
pctvts
for
about
thisisanumber
a
month
and
thinks
indians
will
rent
the
units
for
the
television
and
dvd
the
pctvts
other
technologies
such
as
video
the
pctvts
webcam
to
send
a
picture
of
a
harmful
insect
to
a
local
official
who
could
send
back
a
proposed
course
of
action
to

is
the
real
how
you
can
increase
their
wealth
and
reduce
their
poverty
and
reduce
their
illiteracy
and
improve
their
health
care
and
what
im
postulating
is
that
this
is
the
technology
that
will
enable

the

one

it

good
example
of
this
was

just
lets
them
do

what
they
always
did
but
use
a

it
the
sheer
variety
of
what
the

make

does
gradually
drive
new

that

behind
the
start
of
many

in

using

much
more
than
they
did
five
years

this
was
because
younger
users
often
the
children
of
ageing
mobile
owners
encouraged
older
people
to
try
it
so
they
could
keep

change
in

use
was
the
simple
speed
with
which
new
devices
are
bought
by

what
they
always
did
but
use

the
sheer
variety
of
what
the

much
more

five

this
was
because
younger

often
the

encouraged
older

they

the

speed
with

although
the

he
at

anything

experience

carefully
about

because
of

the
look

bears
more
than
a
passing
resemblance
to
the
better
known

silent

the

simply
to

more

and
a
huge

telewest
offered
standard
thisisanumber
broadband
for
less
than

at
the
beginning
of
the
year
it
was
as
if
an
invisible
barrier
had
been
breached
broadband
had
truly
gone
mass

for

in
a
price
war
reminiscent
of

takeup
of

by

although
such
a
low

raised
eyebrows
among
more
established

questioning
how
they
are
able
to
sustain
such
business
thisisanumber
there
was
no
turning
back
and
the
days
of
waiting
for
the
modem
to
kick
in
began
to
seem
as
outdated
an
idea
as
a
jungle
without
also
falling
in

of

it

shaving
thisisanumber
off
the

socalled

crucial
link
between

the

that

leave
the

of

looking

routinely
enjoying

megabits
per
that
rather
than
just
talk
about
it
companies
are
actually
starting
to
get
their
own
equipment
into
bts
but
it
is
a
remarkable
transition
given
that
just
a
few
years
ago
the
arguments
over
local
loop
unbundling
bore
more
than
a
passing
resemblance
to
the
northern
ireland
peace
talks
fraught
bitter
and
with
no
end
in
broadband
users
in
thisisanumber
was
the
extension
of
bts
reach
meaning
more
than
thisisanumber
of
the
population
could
get
broadband
regardless
of
how
far
away
from
the
exchange
they
those
wanting
to
upgrade
to
thisisanumber
broadband
they
still
have
to
live
within
six
kilometres
of
a
broadbandenabled
to
get
the
technology
the
news
meant
they
could
finally
join
access
over
the
telephone
and
cable
operators
ntl
and
telewest
also
had
a
bumper
increased
speeds
introducing
thisisanumber
and
thisisanumber
services
for
users
and
offering
a
free
upgrade
to
those
on
their
reach
and
it
is
perhaps
testament
to
how
big
a
deal
local
loop
unbundling
could
become
that
even
they
are
considering
extending
their
range
via
this
with
the
huge
amount
of
operators
offering
so
many
different
products
some
with
capped
bandwidth
and
different
length
contracts
and
setup
less
easy
to
understand
in
thisisanumber
but
remains
a
plane
worth
extras
such
as
cheap
telephone
calls
online
the
only
real
thing
to
remember
for
the
coming
year
is
to
enjoy
the

centres
mr
king
said
the
only
way
to
properly
combat
these
socalled
distributed
denialofservice
attacks
was
with
intelligent
netbased
ddos
attacks
are
in
offshore
data
and
hosting
centres
so
any
large
scale
data
flood
could
knock
out
access
to
many
more
sites
than
just
the
one
the
criminals
were
targeting
said
mr
to
grow
as
attacks
grow
in
size
and
said
the
most
common
types
of
attacks
hit
sites
with
thisisanumber
megabytes
of
data
over
short
periods
of
of
traffic
or
more
were
rarely
seen
he
turning
the
dial
because
you
see
this
traffic
gradually
growing
he
attacks
involving
gigabytes
of
data
said
mr
only
a
matter
of
time
before
such
large
attacks
were
pipex
said
that
when
ddos
attacks
were
at
their
height
customers
were
getting
hit
every
four
to
five
constantly
monitor
the
streams
of
data
flowing
across
networks
and
pluck
out
the
traffic
destined
for
target
and
keeping
attack
traffic
from
going
to
the
site
she
traffic
and
as
soon
as
we
see
an
anomaly
in
the
profile
thats
when
we
start
to
get
the
backbone
engineering
boys
to
see
if
we
are
going
to
sustain
an
attack
said
ms
spot
because
ddos
attacks
typically
use
thousands
of
computers
in
many
different
countries
each
participating
machine
only
sends
a
small
part
of
the
entire
data
by
a
virus
or
worm
which
reports
its
success
and
the
net
address
of
compromised
machines
back
to
the
malicious
hacker
or
hitech
criminal
that
set
off
the
or
bots
and
collections
of
them
are
called
bot
to
help
them
anonymously
send
junk
outside
the
country
that
hosts
the
target
site
so
getting
the
attacking
pcs
shut
off
can
be
do
get
advance
notice
that
an
attack
is
about
to
an
attack
with
some
kind
of
ransom
email
said
ms
service
we
provide
that
customers
notify
us
of
anything
they
have
in

that
would
give
us
forewarning
once
an

is
spotted
dedicated
net
hardware
takes
over
to
remove
the
attack
traffic
and
ensure
that
sites
stay
mr
allows
us
to
detect
attacks
in
minutes
rather
than
let
network
engineers
spend
hours
pulling
the
information
together
said
mr
work
more
closely
together
on
the
problem
of
ddos
attacks
and
pool
information
about
where
they
are
coming
they
originated
has
led

some

this
by

ea
hoped
to
double

doubling

it

which
in
thisisanumber
reported

of

thisisanumber
but
it
remained
a
goal
for
the
more
people
into
gaming
because
games
will
be
more
emotional
mr

predicted
that

he

looks
just
like
the

but
it
will
be

mr
florin
said
that
more
than
thisisanumber
of
all
eas
games
were
sold
to
adults
and
played
by
adults
but
the
perception
remained
that
the
video
game
industry
was
for
to
the
masses
which
bring
out
emotions
ea
said
the
video
game
industry
was
now
bigger
than
the
music
ignore
an
industry
when
people
queue
to
buy
a
game
at
midnight
because
they
are
so
desperate
to
play
it
he
said
referring
to
demand
for
titles
for
such
as
grand
theft
auto
san
andreas
and
halo
sales
and
marketing
in
europe
said
the
firm
was
working
to
give
video
games
a
more
central
role
in
popular
advanced
stages
of
discussions
over
a
reality
tv
show
in
which
viewers
could
control
the
actions
of
the
characters
as
in
its
popular
game
the
controlling
a
family
telling
them
when
to
go
to
the
kitchen
and
when
to
go
to
the
bedroom
and
with
this
mechanism
you
have
gamers
all
over
the
world
playing
the
show
said
mr
an
international
awards
show
similar
to
the
oscars
and
the
grammys
which
would
combine
video
games
music
and
had
to
work
more
closely
with

if
their
heroes
like
robbie
williams
or
christina
aguilera
are
in
them
mr
florin
said
the
challenge
was
to
keep
people
playing
in
their
thisisanumber
thisisanumber
and
year
old
comes
home
from
work
and
still
wants
to

mr

a

the

were
done
to
maximise
the

can
make
from

ms

the

the

it

thisisanumber

that
it
skilfully

concerned
with

overblown

everything
in

lots

an
interesting

that
adds
new
dimensions
to

call
of

endeavour
even
if
it
sacrifices
the
narrative
flow
to
be
its
format
tastes
differ
but
these
wartime
shooters
often
do
seem
to
work
better
on
reason
why
along
with
the
sharper
graphics
a
topend
computer
can
muster
and
the
apparent
notion
that
pc
games
are
allowed
to
get
away
with
a
bit
more
more
detailed
plotwise
and
graphically
and
this
new
adaptation
feels
a
little
rough
and
tricky
not
helped
by
unconvincing
with
zero
question
as
to
your
aim
yet
the
bullets
will
just
refuse
to
hit
between
that
when
you
get
shot
which
happens
regularly
you
are
set
harshly
far
back
and
will
find
yourself
covering
vast
tracts
of
scorched
earth
again
and
challenge
and
is
and
many
players
will
like
it
for
simulator
as
you
will
experience
and
even
if
it
is
not
as
refined
as
its
pc
parent
the
sense
of
being
part
of
the
action
is
thoroughly
colleagues
who
are
disturbingly
bad
shots
and
prone
to
odd
their
commands
and
comments
are
irritatingly
like
this
is
superficial
designed
to
add
atmosphere
and
camaraderie
rather
than
affect
the
gameplay
mechanics
at
gets
more
things
right
including
little
points
like
autosaving
intelligently
and
having
tidier
also
looks
wonderful
making
the
most
of
the
lush
tropical
settings
that
are
reminiscent
of
the
glorious
far
cry
although
we
had
to
ramp
up
the
settings
on
a
highspec
machine
to
get
the
most
out
of
bad
and
it
is
only
because
the
pc
original
was
so
dazzling
that
this
version
sometimes
feels
with
plenty
of
atmosphere
and
a
hearty
abundance
of
enemies
to
shoot
will
be
niggling
puzzlement
as
to
why
it
does
not
break

the

that
bittorrent
is
called

that
point
users
to

happy
to

the

they
are
looking
crippled
the

by
the
legal
campaign
was
suprnovaorg
which
helped
boost
the
popularity
of
the
bittorrent
system
by
checking
that

led
to
the

they
claimed

to
have

caribbean
island
saint

be
able
to
rate

stop
the
spread
of
fake

sloncek
told
the
delft
university
of
technology
who
studies
peertopeer
networks
said
exeem
was
the
next
evolution
in
filesharing
to
be
as
popular
as
bittorrent
and
suprnova
because
early
versions
were
not
taking
enough
care
to
make
sure
good
copies
of
files
were
being
flawed
because
it
is
easy
to
insert
both
fake
files
and
fake
ratings
he
for
record
labels
and
movie
studios
have
worked
to
undermine
kazaa
by
putting
in
sure
files
being
shared
were
high
having
a
system
that
works
and
one
thats
full
of
crap
like
kazaa
he
distribution
and
integrity
he
of
filesharing
systems
are
likely
to
incorporate
some
kind
of
distributed
reputation
system
that
lets
moderators
prove
who
they
are
to
the
network
and
rate
which
files
are
worth
moderation
systems
were
key
said
mr
on
bittorrent
had
driven
people
away
from
sites
such
as
suprnova
but
many
users
had
simply
migrated
to
other
tracker
listing
sites
many
of
which
have
seen
huge
increases

available

which
is
good
news
for
those
who
have
huge

is
a
big
boost
to

in
the
battle

is
as
crucial
as

a
leading

added
that
the
delivery
of
highdefinition
games
of
the
future
was
vital
and
bluray
had
the
capacity
functionality
and
interactivity
needed
for
the
kinds
of
projects
it
was
using
the
technology
in
its
next

highquality

for
the
next

always
focused
on
more
capacity

deeper

for
delivering
higherresolution
playbackhe
added
the
focus
for
games
moving
forward
is
on
increased
on
creating
a
world
which
involves
creating
complicated
thisisanumber
models
and
textures
and
increasing
the
resolution
increasing
the
frame
rate
all
of
these
are
part
of
getting
a
more
immersive
experience
fitting
these
models
on
current
dvd
technologies
means
compressing
the
graphics
so
much
that
much
of
this
quality
is

the
current

is
capacity

start
to
build
these

centres
mr

said
the
only
way
to
properly
combat
these
socalled
distributed
denialofservice
attacks
was
with
intelligent
netbased
ddos
attacks
are
in
offshore
data
and
hosting
centres
so
any
large
scale
data
flood
could
knock
out
access
to
many
more
sites
than
just
the
one
the
criminals
were
targeting
said
mr
to
grow
as
attacks
grow
in
size
and
said
the
most
common
types
of
attacks
hit
sites
with
thisisanumber
megabytes
of
data
over
short
periods
of
of
traffic
or
more
were
rarely
seen
he
turning
the
dial
because
you
see
this
traffic
gradually
growing
he
attacks
involving
gigabytes
of
data
said
mr
only
a
matter
of
time
before
such
large
attacks
were
pipex
said
that
when
ddos
attacks
were
at
their
height
customers
were
getting
hit
every
four
to
five
constantly
monitor
the
streams
of
data
flowing
across
networks
and
pluck
out
the
traffic
destined
for
target
and
keeping
attack
traffic
from
going
to
the
site
she
traffic
and
as
soon
as
we
see
an
anomaly
in
the
profile
thats
when
we
start
to
get
the
backbone
engineering
boys
to
see
if
we
are
going
to
sustain
an
attack
said
ms
spot
because
ddos
attacks
typically
use
thousands
of
computers
in
many
different
countries
each
participating
machine
only
sends
a
small
part
of
the
entire
data
by
a
virus
or
worm
which
reports
its
success
and
the
net
address
of
compromised
machines
back
to
the
malicious
hacker
or
hitech
criminal
that
set
off
the
or
bots
and
collections
of
them
are
called
bot
to
help
them
anonymously
send
junk
outside
the
country
that
hosts
the
target
site
so
getting
the
attacking
pcs
shut
off
can
be
do
get
advance
notice
that
an
attack
is
about
to
an
attack
with
some
kind
of
ransom
email
said
ms
service
we
provide
that
customers
notify
us
of
anything
they
have
in
advance
that
would
give
us
forewarning
once
an
attack
is
spotted
dedicated
net
hardware
takes
over
to
remove
the
attack
traffic
and
ensure
that
sites
stay
mr
allows
us
to
detect
attacks
in
minutes
rather
than
let
network
engineers
spend
hours
pulling
the
information
together
said
mr
work
more
closely
together
on
the
problem
of
ddos
attacks
and
pool
information
about
where
they
are
coming
they
originated

seen
as
a
good
move
for

low

who
before

that
you

is
what
the

a
natural
next
step
said
mr
the

that
the

said
mr

who
also
expected
many
pc

to
release

other
consumers
other
than

would
find
using
the
the

from
an

may
find
it
odd
to
have
something
so
small

sleek
next
to
a
hulking

he

mr

its

dissenting

came
from

changes
the
world
although
the
mac

was
very
cheap
for

it
was
still
expensive
compared
to
many
categories
that
few
consumers
care
about
when

he
said
and
all
of
them
are
pretty
interchangeable
since
the

when

its

has
been
on
a

it

the
past
decade
has
been
nothing
less
than
astonishing
but
the
ability
to
communicate
on
the
go
is
not
the
only
reason
we
are
all
been
added
to
our
handsets
in
the
last
few
years
but
thisisanumber
could
see
another
big
innovation
that
wont
just
see
a
change
in
our
mobile
phone
habits
it
might
alter
the
way
we
listen
to
the
working
on
a
technology
called
visual
radio
which
takes
an
existing
fm
signal
from
a
radio
station
and
enables
that
station
to
add
enhancements
such
as
information
and
that
such
an
idea
has
been
suggested
the
early
days
of
dab
digital
radio
had
similar
intentions
that
never
really
saw
the
light
of
visual
radio
leads
people
to
think
of
television
but
reidar
wasenius
a
senior
project
manager
at
nokia
was
adamant
that
visual
radio
should
not
be
confused
with
the
more
traditional
say
its
not
television
what
were
talking
about
is
an
enhancement
of
radio
as
we
know
it
enabled
handset
when
you
hear
an
artist
you
dont
know
or
theres
a
competition
or
vote
that
youd
like
to
participate
in
you
pull
out
your
handset
and
with
one
click
you
turn
on
a
visual
channel
parallel
to
the
onair
broadcast
youve
just
been
listening
tothat
visual
channel
is
run
from
a
computer
within
the
radio
station
and
sends
out
different
kinds
of
information
to
the
handset
depending
on
what
you
are
listening
track
or
artist
of
a
particular
song
there
is
also
the
ability
to
interact
immediately
with
the
radio
station
itself
in
a
similar
way
to
digital
televisions
red
button
and
even
the
chance
to
rate
the
song
that
is
the
service
especially
attractive
to
radio
stations
who
will
be
able
to
track
the
number
of
people
taking
part
in
such
activities
on
a
realtime
an
additional
source
of
revenue
as
it
is
very
likely
that
advertisers
will
be
keen
to
exploit
new
opportunities
to
reach
transmitted
by
existing
gprs
technology
you
would
need
to
have
that
service
enabled
by
your
for
the
service
as
well
although
it
may
depend
on
your
occasionally
and
interact
itll
be
two
or
three
pounds
per
month
said
mr
is
the
operator
offering
a
package
deal
for
an
all
you
can
eat
arrangement
per
month
the
payment
system
could
therefore
be
similar
to
the
way
that
broadband
internet
works
versus
dialup
assuming
that
nokia
retains
its
market
share
in
handsets
it
is
estimating
that
there
will
be
thisisanumber
million
visual
radioenabled
mobile
phones
in
circulation
by
the
end
of
revolutionary
but
rather
an
evolution
where
we
are
providing
tools
with
which
people
can
participate
in
radio
much
more
easily
than
ever
beforethe
first
visual
radio
service
in
the
uk
will
begin
in
a
few
months
time
with
virgin

who
are
positive
about
the
impact
it
could
have
on
their

with
the

they
can
instantly
purchase

initially
visual
radio
functionality
will
be
limited
to
two
nokia
handsets
due
out
soon
the
thisisanumber
and
thisisanumber
but
if
successful
it
is
very
likely
that
other
manufacturers
will
want
to
join

for
some

they

he
says
the
transition
will
be
completely
seamless
and
the
same
quality
as
the
bigscreen

between
the

and

the
generation
after

pumped
vast
quantities
of

into

as
i
drove
around
lead

and
were
all
better
off
as
a
computer
circuit
boards
that
are
lead
free
too
reflecting
a
growing
awareness
on
the
part
of
the
technology
industry
that
products
have
to
be
designed
and
built
in
more
environmentally
friendly
toxic
materials
like
arsenic
mercury
cadmium
and
other
heavy
metals
in
the
products
themselves
the
manufacturing
process
is
also
being
cleaned
up
with
fewer
complex
and
potentially
damaging
organic
chemicals
used
as
power
supplies
that
are
more
energy
efficient
since
current
transformers
are
astonishingly
wasteful
as
they
charge
our
laptops
mobiles
and
music
the
new
approach
is
to
design
products
that
are
easier
to
or
a
computer
with
toxic
chemicals
or
heavy
metals
in
it
then
extracting
them
can
be
tricky

to

manufacturers
in

since
from
august
the

directive
will
oblige
them
to
accept
returned
products
for
they
build
things
that
are
expensive
or
impossible
to
take
apart
and
will
find
their
profits
hit
something
which
is
likely
to
motivate
them
where

to
the
wider
public
interest
might
fall
on

history
of
developing
new
technologies
with
complete
disregard
for
their
potential
impact
on
the
environment
and
waiting
until
there
is
a
crisis
looming
before
we
try
to
redesign

to
cause

lead
additives
helped
stop
petrol
vapour
exploding
too
early
in
the
cylinder
a
phenomenon
called
knocking
so
they
were
simply
used
without
any
real
thought
for
the
fact
that
the
lead
would
end
up
in
the
different
was
a
lot
more
work
so
it
took
decades
before
it
was
the
technology
industry
and
as
a
result
there
are
billions
of
devices
from
old
mobile
phones
to
antique
handhelds
that
will
have
to
be
recycled
in
years
to
a
lot
of
people
are
going
to
be
buying
a
new
mac
mini
and
throwing
away
their
old
pc
keeping
the
monitor
and
other
its
way
four
or
fiveyearold
computers
are
not
good
enough
to
run
modern
programs
and
its
not
unreasonable
to
replace
the
old
onesive
just
looked
around
my
office
and
i
find
two
monitors
an
old
thisisanumber
pc
two
old
handhelds
three
ancient
laptops
four
antique
mobile
phones
a
collection
of
rechargeable
batteries
and
even
a
sun
workstation
that
is
no
longer
really
much
be
hazardous
waste
the
monitors
alone
will
be
full
of
arsenic
and
lead
but
its
possible
that
some
of
the
components
could
be
to
the
council
recycling
centre
but
its
a
thisisanumber
drive
away
across
town
and
like
many
other
people
my
commitment
to
recycling
is
shallow
at
bins
for
compostable
waste
a
box
for
glass
cans
and
paper
that
can
be
recycled
and
a
black
bin
for
the

scattered
around

ask
for
an

mr

still
had

mr

agreed
we

if
it

then
thats
not
very

certainly
have

you
could

of
a
come
a
long

in
a
very
short
launched
in
late
thisisanumber
many
mobile

were
realising
that
there
was
an
audience
looking
for
something
to
play
on
their
own
handsets
than
own

playing

such
as

it
could
be
a
very
lucrative
to
fill
their

fans
looking
for
a
bit
of
variety
and
hard
core
gamers
who
like
to
play
every

got
immeasurably
better
in

as
the

every

and
such

that
you
typically
find
on

and
many
novel

only
found
on

without
a

of

when

realise
that

can
rack
up

of

consider
that

is
the
fact
that
it

easier
than

even
the
ones
that

thisisanumber
should
adhere
to
are
getting
more

which
means
that

real
that
physics

is
getting

give
you
an

how
to

as

i
remember
why
i
never

because
im
rubbish

just

the

it
was
not
clear
if
the
different

were
appreciably
different
on
the

was
a
bit
confusing
especially
when
using
a

rather
than
the

you
either

is
coming
from
the

digital

that
we
take

you
also
take

some
changes
for

that

it

from

what
is

important
about

and
why
is
it
so
differentthe

of

most

in

providing

technology
to

inside
its

and
its
dominance

means
that
it
now
has
a

is
the

been
slowly
increasing

the

a

role
in
the
imminent
war
on

is
the
convergence
of

with

that
there
is
a

of
money
to
be
made
by
putting
a
computer
underneath
the

of
every
household
and
then
offering

this

was
generally
seen
as
a
capabilities
of

to
make

powerful
as

will
make
the

to
persuade

to
give

sure
that
the
dominance
of
the
pc
market
enjoyed
by
microsoft
and
intel
is
not
allowed
to
extend
to
this
and
using
that
architecture
in
a
games
console
that
is
sure
to
be
a
huge
seller
they
hope
that
the
cell
processor
can
become
the
dominant
technology
in
the
living
room
shutting
out
their
the
tv
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
hope
to
use
this
as
a
base
camp
to
extend
their
might
into
our
traditional
pcs
and
instigate
a
regime

also
be

to
reach

be
pooled

other
so
that
you
can
programme
your
microwave
from
your

for
depends
on
the
widespread
adoption
of
the
cell
processor
and
there
are
as
with
all
things
a
number
of
reasons
it
could
it
requires
programmers
to
learn
a
different
way
of
writing
software
and
it
may
be
that
the
changeover
is
simply
too
difficult
for
them
to
and
intel
are
not
going
to
sit
around

steve

of
what
it

you
need
the
big

which
generally
is
several

down

likely
to
be
the
first

product
to

the

designers
have
said
the
flexible

means
that
it
would
be
useful
for
a
wide
range
of
applications
from
servers
to
mobile
any
smaller
than
a
games
console
however
because
the
first
version
of
the
cell
will
run
hot
enough
to
need
a
cooling
chip
as
a
supercomputer
it
remains
significantly
slower

the

thisisanumber
and
would
support

would
not
confirm
if

the

he
thinks
that

makes
the

more
useful
than
it
would
be
to
a

who
had
never
had
any

getting
redder

in
my

eye
a

appears
the

not

hardly

one

last
the
hype
let
us
get
a
few
things
dealt
with
at
the
outset
yes
the
mac
mini
is
really
really
small
and
yes
it
is
another
piece
of
inspired
apple
on
the
computers
size
and
design
but
it
is
worth
highlighting
that
the
mac
mini
is
a
just
a
a
thisisanumber
processor
a
cddvd
player
a
hard

some
other
technical
bits
and
bobs
and
an
operating
technologies
can
be
bought
at
extra
a
monitor
keyboard
or
mouse
then
you
will
need
to
purchase
those
for
the
money
but
for
under
thisisanumber
you
are
getting
something
more
interesting
than
mere
technical
specifications
apple
mac

as
well
as
ilife

a

that

a

the
the

look
a

the
relatively
low

also
encouraged
the

thought
the

was
designed

a

of

the

would
be
used
to
serve
tv

music
films

partly
due
to
its

this
is
not
the

at

not
in

and
now
the

at

for
the
larger

is
too
small
to
be
realistically
used
as

on
the

with
smaller

hard

it
is
worth
remembering
that
they
only
store

and
as

and
any

the

the

of

it

for

out

who
dont
really
care
about

the
speed

is
not
critical
nor
would
the
rush
to
produce
two

has
sold
almost
thisisanumber
ds
due
to
the
fact
that
the
ds
can
run
any
of
the
catalogue
of
thisisanumber
games
produced
for
nintendos
gameboy
advance
to
cost
between
thisisanumber
and
are
in
one
of
which
is
controlled
by
touch
the
ds
also
lets
players
take
on
up
to
thisisanumber
other
people
via
owners
can
take
each
other
on
even
if
only
one
of
them
owns
a
copy
of
a
particular
sent
text
messages
and
a
media
adapter
for
the
handheld
so
it
can
play
music
and
shops
were
expected
to
open
early
on
friday
morning
to
let
people
buy
a

soon
as
its
released
and
that
means
the

not

games

sales
control
of
europes
handheld
gaming
market
for
a
few
weeks
because
soon
sony
is
expected
to
release
its
psp
players
and
the
psp
is
more
for
older
gamers
it
is
likely
that
the
two
firms
will
be
competing
for
many
of
the
same
to
nintendo
because
of
the
huge
number
of
playstation
owners
around
the
world
and
the
greater
flexibility
of
the
sleek
black
games
can
play
music
and
movies
without
the
need
for
addons
and
also
supports
shortrange

psp
is
likely
to
cost
between
thisisanumber

becoming
a

which
is
initially

later
in
the
summer
for

with
superfast

could
be
a
way
of
differentiating
it
from

this
could
be
one
way
of
gaining
some
of

said
the
uk
national

known
for
being
extremely
hard

that

this
problem
said

they
can
also
be

mr

a
