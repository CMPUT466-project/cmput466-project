boss graeme souness felt newcastle never really danger going uefa cup heerenveen
early goal followed alan shearer strike earned 21 win place uefa cup last 16
obviously winning first leg gave us great advantage said 42 aggregate victory
got goals early minds players job done got goal perhaps made us bit nervous shearers goal moved within 12 jackie milburns club scoring record 200 magpies
souness said think beating record would bearing decision retire season
think got year would stay next year anyway added
struck ball well always done think power pace beat goalkeeper souness paid tribute laurent robert heart much uniteds attacking play
first half really well everything wide player
future please said
