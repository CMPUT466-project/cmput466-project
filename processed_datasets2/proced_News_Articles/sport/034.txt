well goodbye another olympic year usual plenty highs lows athens
obviously theres getting away differing fortunes kelly holmes paula radcliffe
remind events made 2004 another year remember forget athletics
favourite olympic moments kellys success 800m
winning race key success 1500m would bit formality
kelly full shouldnt thoughts going double athens
thought wouldnt 800m best event good fun commentate 1500m nice able part athens story
victory british mens 4x100m relay team bit surprise great climax games
think four jason gardener darren campbell marlon devonish mark lewisfrancis knew deep best chance medal
lads run poorly individual sprints maybe lift game knew something really stake
hicham guerroujs olympic double much bigger achievement kellys global scale
first since 80 years win 1500m 5000m titles
soon added 5000m crown finished commentating jumped ran stairs pushed everyone way gave big hug
african runners embraced tradition mile loves hear roger bannister stories
hicham someone enjoy bit time even though french english good
happened paula athens year obvious low personal level expectations nation well
set circumstances around athens conspired produce dramatic ending think greatly misunderstood
dropping marathon right thing starting 10000m five days later wise
heart head reacting
paula lot little things going wrong preparation day
things like niggling injuries able running sessions feeling pressure race looming ahead
think came start line athens physically emotionally drained
even smallest thing doesnt feel right preparing race marathon 10 miles road hit like brick wall
positive thing paulas olympics learned lot lot people including
purely race paulas victory new york marathon go thrilling
nipandtuck kenyas susan chepkemei dont usually get kind excitement marathons
real delight athletics fans use favourite words paula showed real bouncebackability
bit rarity genuinely inkling race going pan
kelly 4x100m boys victories papered cracks general performance british team
concerned producing enough people capable reaching finals senior level
individual mens finalist track michael east 1500m
beginning look wonder new breed thats things begin look even gloomier british athletics win medals world junior championships italy
dani barnes came fourth 1500m highest finisher team gb
thing dont athletes getting finals junior level really doesnt look good beijing olympics beyond
tell really enjoyed year benita johnson winning world cross country championships back march
absence paula tend think event something african preserve
australian deliver surprise something special
honest getting bored scandals especially balco
wish whole thing would head move
said always pleased drugs cheats caught shows sport standing turning blind eye anymore
positive things balco people starting blow whistle
need people forward help authorities kick cheats
regards case greek sprinters kostas kenteris katerina thanou well suspicions hanging kenteris
bottom line keep letting drugs damage sport stops everyone enjoying
