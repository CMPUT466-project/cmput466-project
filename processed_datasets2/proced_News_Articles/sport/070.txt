yelena isinbayeva may produced another world pole vault record achievement could hide fact best meet ever seen birmingham
hey many meets go without russian breaking world record
apparently isinbayeva cleared five metres training would love put us misery go rather extending indoor record centimetre time
athletics pushing barriers best would like see go 5m competition
mind every time breaks record gets 30000 afford deliberate
world records aside thought encouraging evenings work kelly holmes
looked good positive
agnes samaria came second good shape worlds top three 800m runners season
yes samaria let kelly get away coming back last 200m kelly dominated race beating samaria bit benchmark kelly
gut feeling kelly would like run european indoor championships hasnt convinced fit enough
hand think jason gardener struggling near going required win mens 60m madrid
started well final still could stay frontrunners
jason lot experience indoors reason struggling maintain pace finish
would nice see mark lewisfrancis could done final hadnt got disqualified
blatantly playing falsestart game advantage tripped made look bit silly
view youre meant go gun goes
try unsettle rivals employing falsestart tactic remember false start
said mark looking much better shape
havent seen anything mark jason yet suggests frances ronald pognon run 645 seconds threat europeans
british point view sarah claxtons victory 60m hurdles best thing meet
something else probably went unnoticed melanie purkiss winning womens national 400m race new personal best 5298 seconds
aaas champion wall came second another lifetime best strong 4x400m squad going european championships
scotlands lee mcconnell probably going run real prospect medal
international perspective thought meseret defar disappointing 3000m dont think pacemaking great
canadian heather hennigar set fast early pace could maintain pavey last years shape would given defar real run money
go could hang
expecting bit bernard lagat mens 1500m
usa may sharp still think great shape
kenenisa bekele well beaten markos geneti
half expectations bekele struggling season
hot national indoor arena felt uncomfortable commentary box
think conditions affected distance runners fact defar complained coach race could get breath properly
