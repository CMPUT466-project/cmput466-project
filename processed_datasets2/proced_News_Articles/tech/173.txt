us poised push japan top supercomputing chart ibms prototype blue genel machine
assembled lawrence livermore national laboratory us department energy doe lab
doe test results show blue genel managed speeds 7072 teraflops
current top machine japans nec earth simulator clocks 3586
due next week top 500 list officially charts fastest computers world
announced every six months worked using officially recognised mathematical speed test called linpack measures calculations second
speeds likely make fastest computer system planet yet chip technology powering machine kind found familiar devices games consoles
us secretary energy spencer abraham confirmed machine reached breakneck speed according linpack benchmark
official list published however blue genels position confirmed expected new entries
test results raise bar supercomputing enormously signal remarkable achievement
surpassing 40 trillion calculations second teraflop mark considered landmark time
ibm blue genel prototype 5th speed full version due completed livermore labs 2005
peak theoretical performance expected 360 teraflops fit 64 full racks
cut amount heat generated massive power big problem supercomputers
final machine help scientists work safety security reliability requirements uss nuclear weapons stockpile without need underground nuclear testing
earth simulator held top spot since june 2002
dedicated climate modelling simulating seismic activity
september ibm said another blue genel machine clocked 3601 teraflops marginally surpassing earth simulators performance
achieved internal testing ibms production facility rochester minnesota though official record
another giant enter fray silicon graphics columbia supercomputer based nasas ames research center california
would used model flight missions climate research aerospace engineering
linuxbased machine reported reached top speed 427 teraflops october
supercomputers hugely important working complex problems across science society
massive simulation processing power means improve accuracy weather forecasts help design better cars improve disease diagnosis
ibms senior vice president technology manufacturing nick donofrio believes 2006 blue gene capable petaflop computing
means would capable 1000 trillion operations second
get computer large petaflop start think simulations might complement physical world mr donofrio recently told bbc news website
start proactive interactive innovative area mr donofrio sees supercomputing blue gene machines particular crucial health
believes machines help scientists understand greatest challenges 21st century protein folding
health important problems mapping human genome protein structures
great believer simulation
gives another tool said
structures proteins understood fully drugs tailormade fight diseases effectively
compared current fastest supercomputers blue gene designed consume 15th power 10 times compact
since first supercomputer cray1 installed alamos national laboratory 1976 computational speed leaped 500000 times
cray1 capable 80 megaflops 80 million operations second
blue genel machine completed next year five million times faster
started 1993 top 500 list decided group computer science academics around world
presented international supercomputer conference pittsburgh
