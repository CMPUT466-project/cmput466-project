scientists working ways ensure laptops stay powered entire working day
building batteries new chemical mixes could boost power significantly say industry experts
changes include everything way chips laptops made tricks reduce power consumption displays
ever since laptops appeared amount time last recharges frustration users
survey carried 2000 forrester research found shortness battery life complained feature laptops
focus back performance features said mike trainor chief mobile technology evangelist chip giant intel
90s battery life stuck two 25 hours said laptops last much longer
case improving battery life squeezing lithium ion power packs explained
changes needed get holy grail laptop running eight hours needing recharge
lithium ion never going get said
industry done great job wringing possible energy storage technology new battery chemistries promise cram power space said mr trainor though work still needed done get successfully lab manufacturing
sceptical fuel cells would develop quick enough solid batteries even though potential produce several times energy lithium ion power packs
fuel cells need pumps separators evaporation chambers said
mini energy plant needs shrunk shrunk shrunkintel working component makers test energy consumption parts inside laptop find ways make less power hungry
work led creation mobile pc extended battery life ebl working group shares information building notebooks parsimonious power
improvements power use simply components chips shrinking said mr trainor
intel changed way creates transistors silicon reduce power need
larger scale said mr trainor improvements way voltage regulators made reduce amount power lost heat make notebook energy efficient
said mr trainor research done ways cut energy consumption displays currently biggest power guzzler laptop
many laptop makers committed creating 14 15 inch screens draw three watts power
far power consumption levels screens current notebooks
get close eight hours thats place people see extraordinarily valuable thats industry deliver mr trainor said
