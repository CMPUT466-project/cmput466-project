body oversees net works grows evolves says coped well growth last 10 years start
sense hardly started reaching whole population new chair internet engineering task force ietf brian carpenter says
ietf ensures smooth running organisation nets architecture
broadband takeup growing services like voice tv open interesting challenges net
think voip voiceover internet protocol allowing phone calls made net important challenges old cost models telecoms says dr carpenter
second challenges deeply business model service provider lot infrastructure
voip need little infrastructurea distinguished ibm engineer dr carpenter spent 20 years cern european laboratory particle physics
new chair ietf next big challenge overseeing ipv6 next generation standard information transfer routing across web
cern dr carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications development world wide web wellplaced task
nets growth evolution depend standards protocols ensuring architecture works talks standards crucial job ietf
top priority ensure standards make net work open free anyone use work
net built protocol called tcpip means transmission control protocol internet protocol
computers communicate net unique ip address used send receive information
ietf large international community network designers operators vendors researchers working evolution nets architecture way information sent received
make sure knits together leaving gaps
weve seen interesting effects last years explains dr carpenter
net growing fantastic rate 90s
bit glitch 2000
seeing clear phase consolidation renewed growththat renewed growth buoyed emerging economies like china showing fast uptake broadband net technologies
number broadband subscribers via dsl digital subscriber line doubled year 13 million according figures released 2004
challenges continuing produce standards allow growth rate explained dr carpenter
given net designed whole community done well reach millions
reach whole population make sure scale ipv6 standard replace existing ipv4 allow billions addresses net gradually worked network infrastructure across world
actual number addresses ipv4 limited four billion ip addresses
clearly enough 10 billion people serve technical solution new version ip ipv6
much larger address space possibilities practical limits said dr carpenter
standards vital something complex net making sure standards open work across networks big task
difference next generation standard ipv6 make average net user almost invisible
first goal ipv6 make difference people notice difference
like london telephone numbers got longer
lot process invisible
people usually given ip address without knowing technically deployment started standards settled said dr carpenter
problem net may never disappear completely security
dr carpenter solution comes technological human behaviour
people educated sensible behaviour says ignoring emails claim something
dont think going get worse
people remain concerned security probably would concerned walking along dark street
work make sure better security internet standards
neverending battle sense adds even security improved still worry bit
unfortunately part life
duty
