thirdgeneration mobile 3g networks need get faster deliver fast internet surfing move exciting new services
messages mobile industry 3gsm world congress cannes last week
fast 3g networks focus shifted evolution higher bandwidth service says global mobile suppliers association
3gsm siemens showed system transmits faster mobile data
german company said data could transmitted gigabit second 20 times faster current 3g networks
system available commercially yet motorola us mobile handset infrastructure maker held clinic mobile operators hsdpa high speed downlink packet access highspeed high bandwidth technology available
early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits second mbps compared less 384 kilobits second kbps standard 3g networks
highspeed downlink packet access hsdpa sometimes called super 3g vital profitable services like mobile internet browsing mobile video clips according report published ukbased research consultancy analysys
number companies developing technology
nokia canadabased wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed work together high speed downlink packet access
two companies aim jointly market hsdpa solution global network operator customers
hsdpa theoretically enables data rates maximum 14mbps practical throughputs lower widearea networks said dr alastair brydon author analysys report pushing beyond limits 3g hsdpa enhancements
typical average user rate real implementation likely region megabit second even lower rate double capacity
compared basic wcdma 3g added
motorola conducted five trials technology says speeds 29mbps recorded edge outdoor 3g cell using single hsdpa device
mobile operators opting technology called evolution data optimised evdo
us operator sprint ordered broadband data upgrade 3g network last year
expanding network deploying evdo technology meet customer demand faster wireless speeds said oliver valente sprints vice president technology development contract announced
part 3bn multiyear contracts announced late last year sprint spend around 1bn evdo technology lucent technologies nortel networks motorola provides average data speeds 0305 megabits second peak download rates 24mbps
mmo2 ukbased operator services uk ireland germany opted technology based high speed downlink packet access hsdpa standard
using technology lucent offer data speeds 36mbps next summer isle 3g network eventually support speeds 144mbps
us operator cingular wireless adopting hsdpa using technology lucent alongside equipment siemens ericsson
siemens plans gigabit network may user needs today christoph caselitz president mobile networks division firm says time next generation mobile communication debuts 2015 need transmission capacities voice data image multimedia conservatively anticipated rise factor 10 siemens collaboration fraunhofer germansino lab mobile communications institute applied radio system technology souped mobile communications using three transmitting four receiving antennae instead usual
enables data transmission sending big file video broken different flows data sent simultaneously radio frequency band
speeds offered by3g mobile seemed fast time mobile operators paying huge sums 3g licences
today instead connecting internet slow dialup phone connection many people used broadband networks offer speeds 05 megabits second must faster 3g
means users likely find 3g disappointing unless networks souped
arent lucrative power users computer geeks busy business people avoid urgent tasks reducing potential revenues available mobile operators
gigabit second systems available immediately
siemens says though system works laboratory still assess mobility multipleantennae devices conduct field trials
commercial system could far away 2012 though siemens rule earlier date
