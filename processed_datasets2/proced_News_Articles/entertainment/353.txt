forgot mention grearest danger mouse couldnt better original series could itits always nice see old toons rereleased abysmal thunderbirds movie song think ive completely put
leave classics alone good memories
think remakes good idea
world moves people tend look past things make feel safe
believe whole reason retro become popular
long remake justice original create wider audience possibly entice new generation persons enjoy revive old series
personally id like see cartoons transformers thundercats mask
get full hollywood remakes
leave alone ruin something fond memories first place thunderbirds film apalling patch puppet series grew magic roundabout never without voice eric thompson
love see transformers real actors cgi
make least 15 rating
part reason success classics magic roundabout characters sweet cuddly creatures would expect
moody sarcastic rather human
looking pictures animations new film show characteristics preserved
dougal never smiled like films sort unfortunate habit disneyfying everthing lose real magic made show special first place
fond memories bod least look like would like see someone attempt make film
got right material american blockbuster plot story
bod would likely played tom cruise would undoubtedly girlfriend two

new captain pugwash cartoon made couple years back
like many nostalgia programmes animation time computer created flatcell like animation failed match originals cut paper technique inventiveness woefully inadequate

tv shows battlestar galactica new remakes djs sampling reworking 70s 80s music
even computer games 1015 years ago getting modern reworkings
personally think shows originality leave mistyeyed nostalgia alone
mary mungo midge
course episodes lift would order would use stairs
plus would mary vicky pollard character lives high rise council block yeah wasnt even thereid like see mr
benn brad pitt title role
connery could play mysterious costume shop owner
demonstrates profound lack imagination todays filmmakers continually try remake remodel past effort cash nostalgia
plany modern childrens book would make excellent films tv programmes use instead rehashing pastmr
benn rowan atkinson lead
would loved see dungeons dragons made unfortunately film made didnt scratch
isnt remade yet thundercats id like see
expat living norway recently went period buying dvds many favourite childrens programs 2 daughters
dearest wish however see feature length version noggin appear big screen scandinavian
rainbowi believe childrens classics left well alone surprised magic roundabout well box office especially since going spongebob squarepants movie popular among children original witty modern
magic roundabout never appeal children today many years ago
classics like chorlton wheelies rentaghost terrahawks bodoh list could go onif transformers movie indeed cards first amazon buying copy eagerly waiting front frothy mouth nervous twitch
repackage childhood sell extortionate price dont make citreon c4 advert
id luv see willow wisp big screen sadly without late kenneth williams voices wouldnt
remembers trap voiced late willie rushden superb childrens programme
could morph hold big screen movie even jamie magic torchhmmmmm could go
danger mouse 34 showing age
noggin best childrens programs
problem bringing big screen noone could approach oliver postgates wonderful voices
general leave well alone
originals good time methods used integral part story
imagine could achieved using cgi remake fingerbobs
already disturbing hand antics bearded hippy yoffi could whole new level lifelike fingermousebob builder postman pat fireman sam together epic adventure fire post bricks
ultimate struggle save women love evil clowns krusty gobo
triumph fail miserably find fall
puppet show personally would love see made live action movie joe 90
would worth price admission alone see large screen version joes car
course gerry andersons supermarionation rich seam material worthy bigscreen bigbudget action
thunderbirds movie targetted childrent movie really let
children remember shows affection parents children
people children programmes first shown grown plundering childhoods isnt id hate see bagpuss perfect animation love done shed clunkiness couldnt recreate magic
perhaps remakes done look around mockauthentic style might interested
chorton wheelies jamie magic torch would megathis regurgitation old films tv shows makes angry corporate laziness resting safety peoples ideas guarantees bring
said modern day pop bands release peoples material young etc
sad fact nostalgia sells big bucks shortterm
fact forgotten 6 months time irrelevant
starsky hutch hence market saturated mindless drivel stopped people stop buying pray never remake chorlton wheelies
27 dont remember series tv set dvd classic
fact great comes fact special effects involved compared todays stuff looks amateurish
thats appeal though innocent like chorlton would real shame remake
