us farmers could be eligible for tax cuts if their prices stayed flat under a controversial plan
the policy lets people who buy organic produce and sell that to their relatives or friends at a local supermarket or bank would mean the prices of produce grown on conventional farms would be flat
the tax would apply to all incomes above 250 £takings but excluding items above this level would rise to £21000
the tax is the result of a us federal advisory committee report which recommended a flat tax
the farm bill would also apply to farmers earning more than 5 of the income tax mark on sales from produce produced using conventional methods
although the changes would apply to consumers with incomes above 50000 £takings the committee said the extra level of protection would be worth taking if consumers had incomes above 50000 subsidising incomes
the committee was given the green light to include the flat tax in the final farm bill
the idea was first floated by the committee agricultural policy chairman bernie ebbers said
the farm bill was due to become law on the thursday of the expected expected 15 february
the committee reported last year that organic farmers earn an average of 625 £484 per head  less than half of the average tax payer pay they tax free rates
the average tax rate for an organic farmer is 16
fiftyfive of organic farmers are working poor  12 are earning more than the minimum wage of 40000 £20 per week
the committee said that the organic sector should provide a net revenue model for its shareholders
it said the total amount of money that the shareholders of the company could receive from the sale of organic produce was limited at best to a very modest amount and was likely to be much less than that
it urged the organic community to set up a fund to encourage shareholders to invest in better products

by the end of the 1990s rogers was still struggling to maintain his image as a force to be reckoned with in the world of sport
his first major championship was the french open in round one in 1999
he was replaced by mikhail youzhny in 2001
and he has since won six major championships in oneenheim as well as two in lisbon
the 22yearold has therefore struggled to maintain his image as a great french player  but he has not been defeated in a major grand slam final
perhaps the most difficult aspect of preparing for the australian open has been learning how to play the roger moya style of tennis
meanwhile a new breed of french players are being brought in to replace the old
kid foxx and the new breed of french open champion simon hussain have both been replaced by fellow simonian jeanphilippe grandclaude
meanwhile the french open champion fabrice santoro and the french open champion uk open champion serena will take part in the doubles in madrid later in the month
the doubles will be played at the lisbon court
foxx has won three times in australia at the court de vivre while santoro has held the alltel title twice since 2001
but santoro has been unable to recover from a knee injury which forced him to miss the davis cup final
the mens doubles will be played at the famous lisbon court
the doubles will be televised by channel 3 satellite and will be broadcast throughout the world from 628 february
foxx has won three times in australia at the court de vivre while santoro has held the alltel title twice since 2001
but the davis cup final was the key deciding factor in the final between the pair of james bond and terry jones
foxx had been suffering a miserable defeat in the last 16 of the davis cup in madrid
the american had looked set to secure his place in this years french open championship but the rain delayed his start
the american who had lost the last three davis cup games to bond and jones was looking for his first davis cup victory since the 2003 davis cup final at the old trafford pavilion
the rain had to be responsible for his early efforts
as the match approached he began to lose control of the match and began to lose control of

the time has come for the industry to wake up and make europe an economy that works for everyone
a small group of firms including rsi and aol have just made europe an economy where employees have more say over key issues like immigration and national security
the effort will be supported by a huge increase in government spending
according to the financial times the government is spending more than it is reducing
but the big winners are still going to be those at the top
risca industries dominate the european economy
with more than a quarter of a million workers risca is the worlds biggest private employer
but over the last 18 months the industry has been undergoing an enormous change
its profits have stagnated and its share price has fallen
according to recent figures riscas revenue from nonresidentbased workers rose by £36bn but this was offset by a 3 rise in earnings from foreign workers
according to the financial times the majority of the new workers are from outside europe
but the biggest losers are the most vulnerable sectors of the economy particularly the least well off workers
a majority of workers in this area are aged 65 or over
however a significant number are from outside europe
the aim of this congress is to raise the awareness of employers and their staff of the benefits of employing foreign workers in riscas industry and to clarify the rights of riscas workers in russia and southern asia during their employment in europe
this is a good start said risca chairman emilio totegar
i hope it will pave the way for companies to look across the sector and start considering options to employ riscas workers in russia and southern asia
we want to make sure that riscas remains an economic powerhouse said totegar
the aim of the congress is to establish guidelines for employers and employees allowing them to work in harmony with riscas laws and regulations
some russian companies have already filed for bankruptcy
many russian small and large companies are adopting a culture of investing in new products and technologies

it seems that the more money you make on your investments the more money you will get in the future from futureprofits
this is the same logic that led to the gold standard  to the advantage of early investors
a bank that makes money by selling worthless bonds cannot be trusted
the bond market is a bubble
bond prices need to be inflated to make money in it
the more money a company makes the greater the chance of getting in for any kind of a bust
the only money that can be salvaged from a corporate bankruptcy however is vested interests and the stability of corporate governance
the bond market is a bubble
the markets are ruled by the public
we have to have enough of them so that the market is not overbought
the better the markets the more money a company can make and the larger the returns on investment
if you dont invest enough money in a portfolio then the market will fall in value and it will be difficult for bondholders to save up the cash to buy bonds instead
the best way to prevent a bubble is to let people decide for themselves
this will require a collective capacity to create their own destiny and a willingness to let markets determine their destiny
the bond market is not perfect
sometimes markets work hard sometimes they don
but the reality is that we are all at risk if we just ignore the risks
if bond prices are driven up then bonds will have a stronger and stronger drag on the markets
if the market is driven down further then that means that the companies are in danger
in any case the market is strong but the public still has a role to play

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean banks are to pause work on wednesday to allow more money to flow into their markets amid concerns that more cash could be held cheaply
the banks said they were seeking other ways of boosting cash to meet growing demand
the freeze will mean that firms will have to invest more to meet soaring cash needs and the pressure is on south korea to remain strong in the face of tougher uk foreign reserves
south korea has been unable to recoup more than 3 trillion won £22 billion from the us since the end of the cold war
it has stepped in to curb the flow of cash to the worlds most indebted economies
the south koreans have estimated the us reserves at more than one trillion won
south korea has said the money will be secured in cash by selling assets to foreign banks and selling assets to domestic financial institutions
the freeze also means that bank loans to south koreas big businesses will no longer be funded by the frozen dollars
banks will now need to focus on buying more assets to meet growing foreign reserves the south korean financial press reported
the banks said they had already bought assets which could be used to finance the extra cash
in effect the south koreans are buying the perception that there is more than one money supply and they can hold their money indefinitely the paper said
the banks will now need to curb the amount of cash they can hold cheaply enough to prevent the spread of corruption and the spread of risk in the banking system the paper added
the freeze on wednesday also meant that foreign currency trading will no longer be allowed in south korea
there will be restrictions on buying foreign currency in europe and yen markets the banks said
the money will be held in a subsidiary unit in the south korean central bank or kcsbc the south korean bank
it is a small piece of uk government largess that has helped the uk become the worlds most indebted economy
many of the poorest nations in south korea have been pressing the government to ease economic sanctions imposed on japans richest neighbour
south korea is a large trading partner of the us and the us dollars have an important trading relationship with china
the south koreans are also huge exporters of currency and tech currencies
it is not known whether the money will be frozen out of the country or whether it will still be able to

or the shortbread and fastfood networks
the waiting list is long
you can get a phone with a camera and a keyboard from the us rather than the usual monthly fee of about 12
a third of the countrys population are being denied access
government statistics show that in december 2004 the number of people denied access in the us went up by 10 to 15 million
but as of november 2005 the number of people denied a fastfood job rose by just over one million
the government has announced that the federal government will provide funding at noiuma costs for the government and state and local government to help fight the problem of fast food access
the role of the federal government is to create a national network of communitybased fast food outlets and to ensure that those outlets are high availability and high quality
the strategy is to set up a network of 100000 fast food outlets in 35 countries and build a network of networked locations so that the total number of fast food customers in those countries is doubled every five years
the goal is to have 100000 fast food outlets by the summer 2005 and this number will rise
the goal is to have 20000 outlets by the winter of 2005 and then 20000 outlets by the summer of 2006
the number of fast food restaurants in the uk is set to triple by 2007 with more than 5000 by 2008
more than 6 million uk households now serve food from franchise restaurants
the number of fast food restaurants will double to 24 million by the middle of the century
the problem of fast food is becoming a daily part of everyday life says mr walters
mr walters says he is confident that by 2007 the numbers of people going to the supermarket will double to 350 million

the office of national statistics ons said on wednesday that the number of people without power in wales had fallen by 178000 since december 2004 from 822 million in october to 2003
it also said that figures showed that one in five households in the uk had power for just over the winter
the government is also trying to cut carbon emissions from coal power stations  currently the largest source of electricity  by pledging a 25 cut in stamp duty by the middle of the year
the cost of carbon emissions from coal has fallen by more than 50 since 2003
the government is also attempting to cut the amount of wind and solar farms used  often used to generate electricity  by pledging a cap at each gigawatt hour used over the course of the year
the oneoff charge has also been cut by £550 from the power tariff introduced by the power corporation power
the cuts come on top of recent reductions announced by the utility and local electricians groups to help meet energy demand
the government said the wholesale reductions in wholesale electricity prices of 20 to 30 were the result of a 20 price drop in november for homes in trust and £520 cost of £168 in rented units
the price drop was due in part to the introduction of a local household efficiency credit scheme
the £170 price reduction is aimed at households in disadvantaged areas of wales
the increase in wholesale price is due in part because of the introduction of an oneway tariff on coal power in the mid1990s the office for national statistics ons said
that initiative helped ignite the debate about public ownership of electricity
the current wholesale price of 83 abatement cents is now £168
the £170 price reduction is due in part because of the introduction of a local household efficiency credit scheme

sugar should not be a new product category that people must abide by said mr howard
we are very cautious of products that are not being promoted and we are very cautious of products that are being marketed that are not being marketed now
sugar is a complex crop and very complex
if we dont all be labelled as being sweet as sugar there will be a problem

the show at the ritz has become a global phenomenon with more than 19000 tickets sold worldwide
it was the stars first public appearance since king kongleer left the rogers house in 1994
other celebrities to join the party included mr howard hughes kate winslet alexander and the late king kiwis
everyone was dressed in the ritzy style including the queens of hollywood
sir paul mncaw jr and king kongleer were among the stars who made a spectacle of themselves at the party

ukraine is to open a cannabis market in the first big expansion in the country in nearly a year
the egyptian government has approved the launch of a 1 trillion £26bn 5bn cannabis industry
the move is aimed at boosting tourism and tourism revenue in the country
the egyptian government hopes to prevent a decline in the number of tourists to the country following the legalisation of the plant
in the us sales of cannabis have already exceeded 90m an annual growth rate of more than 30
the egyptian government hopes to treat cannabis as a chemical or biological drug using two basic principles to regulate it
firstly cannabis will have to be treated and regulated in accordance with the first amendment the government has said in its application for a special economic zone in the united states
and secondly it intends to create a framework for regulatory improvement both as a result of the settlement of these issues and in the interests of overall public health
the focus now is on boosting exports and tourism both in the united states and in the region
the egyptian government is an exceptional case in that it has applied for a special economic zone outside the traditional us market
this is a sensible move indeed said john nakower an analyst at wager th man
but it remains to be seen whether the government will be persuaded to come up with a practical approach which will satisfy both investors and the country as a whole
the government has limited resources available to it in this area
however it has a legalistic claim that it can regulate the plant as it is grown in an economically responsible way
a few weeks ago a study was published in the medical journal the journal of the medical association of america that suggested a 50ppm growth rate over a 21 year period could be achieved
i think the government should push for a 50ppm figure
i think the governments argument has to be weighed against the egyptian government
i think they should give the government the tools to regulate it in the way that theyve done in the past
theyve done that much better than us
i think the governments argument is that theyve treated cannabis as it is treated a criminalised practice
i think theyre doing it in a way that is beneficial to the government and egypt
it seems to me that is what the governments interest is at least qualitatively a detailed discussion of the regulatory framework and how this can be structured in a way that promotes public health and promotes exploration of the potential benefits of these

we are extremely pleased to have signed the agreement to work together to defeat this threat the usbased temp systems will be built on a technology called swarm systems  sba
a dedicated server farm will be set up at the sony datastore network
this will be used to process the dailyloads of data that can be sent across datacentres
the sb will act as a coordinating point for the heavy lifting said mr morley
other key tasks include preparing the way for attacks to be mounted across the digital music and internet services disrupted services and for those tapes or digital photos that can be safely and permanently deleted
the total amount of data that can be deleted over the internet is enormous and the amount of data processed and returned is enormous said mr morley
the total amount of data that can be stored forever is set to explode after the next big thing is a distributed denial of service attack or distributed denial of service for that matter
when that happens many firms will suffer the consequences said mr morley
the attacks will be carried out on nearly any type of digital media including mobile phones and digital cameras
they will be carried out to yield significant information that could lead to the three key pieces of information being misused in a successful attack said mr morley

us traders who have lost billions of dollars by selling shares on futures exchanges in the us are thrilled
i was completely shocked by the market reaction
i am not a trader but i have seen this before jeremy flake analyst for deutsche boerse told reuters
the market has reacted differently than we have
we are hedging our positions
we are selling a hedge
we are selling a hedge
we are selling money hedging and ultimately we are really trading money hedges said mike henderson chief executive of futures direct investment banking mfins
we are acting as if the money is real hedging and hedging and hedging and ultimately the money is traded in the market he added
chartered banks and financial institutions  financial institutions that handle investment banking  are expected to push for stronger performance in 2005
according to recent market forecasts hedge funds and financial institutions will outperform in other economic conditions in 2005
the key to this is how much of their returns are actually used to pay out dividends
for the moment they are doing exactly that he said
profits are forecast to be about 60 of earnings after tax
profits are due in 2005
however analysts are predicting a 5 year forecast for earnings and profits
british equities markets are looking pretty strong right now
according to market analysts the biggest stock market blip in nine years has been in the us equities market
the dow jones index of leading us equities closed up 21 points to 4955 from 4965 in november 2004
analysts said that if the market could do without the election of president george w bush the election of him as a budget winner and the overall economic recovery continues to be strong
the dow is doing very well despite the fact that the dollar has weakened
a weaker dollar and a higher cost of doing business in the world are expected to hurt economic growth in 2005
growth will be slower in 2006 than in any year ahead said rupert murdock chief market strategist at deutsche boerse
however the dow is gaining momentum
it is gaining momentum despite a poor showing in the last three months of last year hitting the buffers
the benchmark dow is closing at 4940 a Fibonlass before moving up 22 on the gain of 1360
the main dow is now holding above 55 however
this is improving as the markets see evidence that the economic recovery is on the way which will lead to a rebalancing of the economy the market

seems like only the second time someone from the nintendo games office has walked through the door of the nintendo 3ds handheld and said it was better than the 3ds
i dont think the gamecube was a very good portable console
it probably wasnt very good and the nintendo 3ds handheld was better
it was a disappointment
i disliked it first and played it over and over
i still do
i just can no longer believe that someone at nintendo made a device so different from the 3ds in every way
theyre the same design core and screen but lower price
i dont think so
i assume its just the nostalgia for when the 3ds was the most played device among kids however its definitely not the case with the nintendo 3ds
theyre the same gadget but with a different screen and a slightly different gameplay experience
i doubt many gamers will jump ship with the old nintendo 3ds because they didnt sell the device well before the handheld went on sale
the build quality of the gamecube version isnt that bad compared to the gameboy advance
but the gameplay is a bit more frantic and the price is a bit more expensive
the gamecube version is playable in about 30 seconds compared to 30 seconds on the old gameboy
just be warned that the nintendo 3ds handheld has a slower internet connection and this is because of the small screen on the nintendo gameboy
the average consumer will find this odd
far better portable than the 3dmark 11 or the ds10 or even the xbox
not a bad handheld
maybe its just a niche market  maybe its just a niche market
the marketing for the gamecube version of doom 3 was good enough to tempt the average consumer
but the nintendo 3ds version of doom 3 was bad enough to tempt the average consumer
how on earth did the nintendo 3ds get onto the shelves at the end of the day when the old gameboy was king and how did the ds get onto the shelves at the same time when the new game was king  the key moment in the evolution of the portable handhelds display
it was about time a new generation of nintendo fans got their hands on these two extremely impressive handhelds
despite being slightly smaller than the ds on the market the nintendo 3ds proved to be as powerful as the portable it was compared to the ds
it wasnt until just a few months after the ds launched

britains economy is set for strong growth in 2005 and if it keeps pace with the pace of job growth growth the economy could grow by more than 10 in 2005
the economy is set to grow by 45 in 2005 and by 35 in 2006 says the government
the main driver behind the growth is the continuing strength of the dollar with employment expected to rise by 12 in 2006
the economy is set to grow by about 15 in 2005 with growth expected to slow from the highest level in recent years
however although the economy grew by only 23 in 2004 it has bounced back strongly from the early tangentas days when it was a relatively small contributor to gdp
however now the biggest contributor is the continuing strength of the dollar with employment registering a slight rise thanks to the governments efforts to cut trade barriers
the main driver behind the growth in the uk in 2005 is job creation which is set to buoy the economy even further with the number of net jobs set to grow by a further 12
the main driver behind the slowdown in job creation in the last few years is falling oil prices which will help keep the uk in the gold standard
the main driver is falling oil prices but there are also signs that the economy is becoming less driven by domestic demand
according to government figures the economy contracted by 07 in december 2003 partly due to a decline in demand for oil
it is likely that the fall in oil prices will remain a drag on the uk economy in 2005 a report from consultancy forecast predicts
growth could slow in the short run with economists forecasting overall growth to slow by about 3 in 2004

meanwhile relief groups are trying to work out the best way to distribute the aid so that it can all be used at once the usf 100 which is based in japan has started talks with the international monetary fund imf on wednesday about a possible cash injection

the housing market is set to slow in the runup to the general election widely expected next april
the office for national statistics ons said the number of people in work in the month up to may was down slightly from 14 million in 2003 to 13 million
however the good economy outlook is still a positive factor in the survey
however a strong labour market and household budget could help boost demand for housing and other building materials by reducing stamp duty
the economy will grow at an annual rate of about 4 in the next three years
the government forecasts a rate cut of about 3 next year  with inflation at an alltime high of 4  while a recovery in manufacturing and consumer spending will continue
however the economy will continue to expand at a slow pace and inflation will remain low
the economy is still seen as the driving force behind the publics confidence in the countrys current account
however the picture is seen as more aggressive action is needed on inflation and the housing market
the economy will continue to grow at a moderate pace with inflation at 4 and the labour market at its slowest for a decade
the uk is not likely to have a similar situation in george w bushland until at least 2006

the european central bank has said it will cut interest rates once again next month in an effort to combat falling demand for credit
the move follows a fall in the value of the pound to a record low against the euro
the bank said it also plans to raise its benchmark interest rate
the rate cut is designed to take place as demand for credit exceeds supply and let the economy respond
it is scheduled to close on 14 december
in january the uk eased limits on how much it wanted to hike interest rates by increasing its current account deficit by £18bn or £21bn
the money brought in last year has been put to a sharp upswing during the next few months as the economy slows
it has driven exports higher but kept the inflation rate at 2 which is already well above the five percentage point mark seen as too much inflation in many countries around the world
the bank also said it was reviewing the way it measures lending to countries such as china and indonesia
the level of economic growth is likely to be driven by a narrowing of the middle east and asian economies
the economy is set to grow by about 4 this year
the money market is likely to remain weak however with the uk bank estimating

the economic situation which was already becoming much worse in 2004 has taken a turn for the worse
the unemployment rate fell slightly to 47 from 47 in december to 47 in december according to the labor ministry
but the number of people out of work has stayed relatively stable in recent months as companies look to cut costs
the fall in the participation rate to 54 reflected the strength of the labour market following the gains made in the last few months of 2004
the participation rate has been falling steadily since december but analysts cautioned that if the average rate were to fall to 53 it would still leave the labor ministry with a jobless rate of 47
the participation rate was at its lowest point since the early 1990s and the participation rate has fallen markedly in the last year said mr li
in january the ministry of employment completed its survey of 200000 firms but did not provide firm figures
the ministry did not comment on specific companies but said the december survey showed that a strong employment situation was continuing
it added that the december survey included only companies that had been excluded from the labor market
the government has yet to publish the final figures although they suggest that the labour market is having to do with the strength of the economy rather than the low interest rates which are causing the economy to find more space in a longerterm inflation context

the number of people out of work in england has risen by 7 in november the government has said

the expected announcements come as the economy begins its slow march towards full employment

the lord chancellor has been asked whether david blunkett  who was at the centre of the 2003 downing street attacks  was his financial enemy
lord purkiss told bbc news there is a very deep enemy within me which is very hard to describe he said that mr blunkett was not a person for whom politics had been something personal
i had two very important friends who were very very harsh on me he added
lord purkiss added that mr blunkett who resigned from the cabinet in march last year after 12 years at the top of the government and 11 months as his personal bodyguard and managing director of the sindfordshire office had a profound effect on him
i think what david blunkett sees as the fundamental enemy within me is not necessarily but is a tremendous enemy within the lord chancellor
he saw me as a man who was untouchable and who was formidable but who was so driven by his personal ambition  and he saw me as a man who was going to hell

of course there is the question of how to make an acceptable showing on the tax authorities and any such decision is expected to be made by the end of this year
earlier this week the prime minister said he was confident the changes were going to be put in place by the council of income tax officials
mr blair has pledged to publish a report on the issue within six months
it is expected to be published by the end of may
the government will give the chancellor more time to improve the competitiveness and tax systems of the two major tax systems mr blunkett said
the former constitutional affairs minister left david blunkett  now at labours hartlepool south east  with wife ashley after they decided to quit labour
mr blunkett  who had been in government at the same time as mr brown  said he was proud of his predecessor david laws of 2003 which gave priority to nations with low income earners
the aim was that those countries which received more tax would tend to have an even more concentrated tax base
mrs laws was a key element of the soviet reforms which the tories claim are needed to reverse the problems facing the poor
he told bbc radio 4s today programme we needed a political commitment to a unified package of tax and spend reforms
from a fiscal conservative government we would cut taxes by about £3000  but not more than that mr blunkett argued
conservative shadow chancellor oliver letwin said it was wrong to claim the tories would cut taxes
there are some very good reasons why we have been pushing for a big increase in income tax over the last year
firstly we realised that we needed to get the money out quickly
secondly we realised that the cost of doing business with germany has dropped considerably
thirdly we realised that the cost of running our own banks has gone up and we are able to spend more of our own resources in a more effective way
and finally we realised that in order to have a serious debate about this we have to have solid policy proposals that address important issues in their entirety before the parliament can debate them all
mr blunkett is expected to say later this week that he wants to make tax reform a priority of the taxes system in the united kingdom
he was due to outline the governments plans at a cabinet meeting on monday  but the prime minister cancelled it a day ahead of the expected date of the meeting

by ossie hawking from scottish canton
in an effort to end illegal immigration it is increasing the number of people coming into the uk
immigration has always been a political issue in scotland and the new labour government has brought in some of the most conservative and hardline immigration judges from scotland
but this government has tried to do away with the system entirely
scotlands law is based on the principle of habeas corpus and a law that applies to all claims for immigration and stays in force until the case of a single migrant are heard
the government argues that the number of claims being processed at this stage is too few to meet the current backlog of 500000 claims
this is a staggering number and the government is desperate to get people back on track
they will not accept a formal apology from the government but will seek a second opinion from a judge who will hold a second opinion if the government cannot get hold
the government has already committed itself to increasing the number of migrants admitted to scotland by 2005
this is a monumental task and one that scotland cantons should inherit from the eu
but the government is determined to get people on the track and to end the needless levels of immigration scottish nationals are already being admitted
they already have asylum status in scotland but this decision is the result of a cabinet which has decided to extend this status to scotland scotland has already experienced severe difficulties with asylum and immigration cases because of ongoing political divides
the government has tried to make scotland a more effective forum for dealing with this problem
but many people in scotland are concerned that the number of scottish nationals in the uk is increasing
theyve been left with the impression that scotland is on the verge of an implosion and that the threat of a civil war
as a result they are wrong
this government is determined to cut scotland down to the bone by pushing the asylum system into a state of emergency
it is taking the necessary steps to ensure that these decisions are taken swiftly
it has the legal authority to impose the measures but it is refusing to follow up with legal force
and scottish national party leader david mcletchie has said the government has no option but to accept the mass of migrants entering the uk illegally
the very fact that immigrants are coming to the uk shows that it is workinghe mps have said

mrs campbell and fairbairn are the authors of a report into the war on terror by the watchdog ofcom
the report which questioned whether the current system of checks and balances was working effectively the mps decided not to raise the issue in parliament
the report which was published at the end of november called on the government and intelligence committees to investigate the war on terror
meanwhile intelligence chiefs are examining whether there was widespread coordination between the intelligence community and the terror organisations to gather intelligence on the plots
the report also raises questions about intelligence sharing between the agencies and the public
the department for constitutional affairs has said it is examining whether intelligence was passed along to the security services
but a spokesman said the aim of the inquiry was to establish whether there was common ground between the security services and the intelligence communities
there have been some concerns that the intelligence received before the 11 september attacks could be used to justify surveillance

tony blair has said how the conservatives can help to elect a law and order party in england and wales
its a view that is in the very heart of brownys heart he told bbc radio 4s today programme
mr blair also said the british public had a vital role to play in the campaign against terrorism
he added its not a party of one per cent but of five or six representatives  and they should all be represented in the house of commons
he repeated the call for a unity government with his pledge to make sure all people had the information they needed to make decisions for themselves
the lib dems have also said they would welcome any information on a possible unity government
but executive editor of the daily telegraph sunday telegraph said this would be a central issue in the general election  and the prospect of further tussle between the two big parties would be an enormous boost to the campaign
dr jonathan kaplan from the freedom of information coalition said the information commissioners ruling would set a dangerous precedent
the information system should be free to every individual consumer and nation he said
this ruling will set a dangerous new precedent for the information democratic future
it is therefore necessary that the information democratic future commission  a union of information watchdog agencies  look into this situation

us mortgage firm fannie mae has received a court injunction that could prevent it turning around its finances
fannie mae bought a 575bn £428bn holding company in an auction in december last year
however it had previously said that it was exploring other investment opportunities
however fannie mae which owns 5 of fannie mae could face a quarter of a billion in repurchases next month
however the firm has previously said that it expected to raise money from other investors by selling its shares
however last year the firm warned that a quarter of a trillion dollars of debt would be left uncollected if it bought the holding
however the bank of america said in december that losses from fannie mae would be minimised by restructuring
fannie mae also said in december that it would seek to buy back shares in fannie mae
the sale of fannie mae may have further to follow discussions of future us and european stock markets
the firms shares jumped to a record high on monday after fsa officials said they were likely to raise at least 1bn £26bn in the next few weeks
however the uk government has said that the money may not come from taxpayers
the uk securities watchdog has said that it may look to sell off some of its mortgage divisions
committee chairman sir menzies campbell said the us mortgage market had become a particularly difficult market for fannie mae with mortgage approvals set to fall by 6 this year
the firm has blamed a string of failures and scandals over the past three years for its reliance on junk bonds
last month it warned it may default on about 2bn of its own money
a final order of repurchase of fannie mae was issued on thursday and the market is set for a record fourth month of growth
fannie mae is the largest federal reserve holding of private finance agency stock market funds and commercial banks

government figures released on friday showed that the number of people in work and poverty lived in significant decline for the first time in almost four decades
in november 2004 almost 43 million people lived below the poverty line
nowhere was the economic growth more evident than in the manufacturing sector with the number of people in work falling by almost a third
the number of people in work fell from 127 million in november 2004 to 62 million in november 2004
but the downward trend continued into december last year when the number of people in work fell from 922 million in november 2004 to 922 million in november 2004
the decline in industrial production continued into december last year when the number of people in work fell from 2026 million in november 2004 to 923 million in november 2004
the number of people in work was 32 million in november 2004 but grew by 25 in the last 12 months to 14 million in the last 13 months
but the number of people in work rose 16 in november 2004 to 18 million in november 2004
the numbers of people in work living in poverty were even lower with 13 million people living below the poverty line in november 2004
but the figures should be taken with a pinch of salt
despite continuing the upward trend many in the labour market sector remain concerned that rising unemployment and household debt could undermine the growth of the economy
in light of the continuing narrowing of the labour market participation rates for all sectors of the economy including manufacturing continue to be an important indicator of economic health

the head of indian telecoms giant nokia has denied reports that the firm is considering buying back its former parent

the biggest gaming market in the world has seen its share of console sales soar over the past year
the industry is now seeing the potential to become a global entertainment powerhouse
the success of two of the more popular xbox games halo 2 and title henry will play a part in boosting the share
but analysts believe that halo 2 will be the driving force behind the trend
the racing title has sold more than 17 million copies and its stunning visuals have also boosted demand
the launch of halo 2 has also boosted the number of people who want to play the game on xbox
gamers are also eager for a more familyfriendly experience because xbox games are proving easier to play and organise around playtimes easier than ever
sony and nintendos handhelds have topped the charts for a number of years
both have excellent visuals and have become hugely popular because of the enormous replay value that comes with owning one
but sonys playstation 4s always on and even the ps2s free to play feel like a childhood wish for video games
both have trouble finding homes and are looking to expand as the market becomes more diverse
sony seem to have found their ideal demographic by targeting an entire new group of gamers
they are looking to appeal to a younger audience by targeting young and under18s who are interested in playing video games but also extremely excited about the chance to try them

michael yarnton is not alone in his belief that we need a new breed of competitive sports car
the american sports car industry is rapidly overtaking that of japanese competitors
over the last 18 months britain has seen its total number of car sales increase by more than 40
that trend is predicted to continue into the next several years
the us has seen its sales rise by almost 80 although it has seen rapid falls in some key markets such as asia
the trend is best explained by the rise in the number of online buyers who are buying for their relatives and friends
online sales are predicted to reach 14 billion in 2004 according to us trade publication gm
however analysts are divided on the exact figure
we see a clear downward trend for us sales over the last 18 months said jonathan schoon director of gartner
if sales are doing that kind of thing in the us next year will be significant for us
we are seeing growth at the expense of our regional competitors gartner added
however i dont think there is a quantitative way to measure that yet
if japan and asia are the two fastestgrowing markets in the world then us sales will be even higher
analysts also agree that the slowdown in the uk property market and general economic slowdown are likely to continue into 2005
overall i would expect a smaller overall increase in us sales than in europe
but overall i would be surprised if it were the double dip in house prices in the summer
sales in the uk equated to 10bn in december were down slightly from a peak of more than 12bn five months earlier
the decline in uk sales from the previous month has been blamed on sterling weakening against the dollar and the impact of sterling depreciation on exports

worldcom will join forces to set up an internet portal that lets people reach their ecommerce online using just one click
the two companies aim to offer a portal for general orders orders while highlighting their strong collaboration on the technical side
the new service will give people access to trade and commerce data and pricing information while showcasing how much each item costs
the service is expected to go live in beta within the first two months
worldcom is an usbased ecommerce and hardware company
we have a vision for commerce that we can implement in our site said steven soderling chief executive of worldcom
worldcom currently has only two million active users and as more and more products are launched online there will be more users
analysts said that although worldcom had a solid vision worldcom did not have the engineering or financial resources to take on the problem
however worldcom is likely to be the first to go in the next five to 10 years
internet search is a vital way for people to find information about jobs and other opportunities around the world
for the moment search is done mainly by voice mail services such as ours which have a lot of unwanted users and are difficult to replace
but with voice mail services expanding coverage around the world it is becoming almost impossible to replace voice mail with a desktop computer
while internet users are likely to be more active on the web search is still going strong
according to figures gathered by mobobi and metapal this will reach 100 million in 2005
the number of people using mobobi net for instant messages and other online discussions grew 10 million during the same period during 2004
but that did not stop companies like google and yahoo from investing in web search
they are able to reach millions by using a combination of text and voice mail services
yahoo said that in the next few years it predicts that its total number of users will reach 100 million or more
it hopes to offer web searching using both voice and data mail services
yahoo is also working on ways to make email more secure using technology already in use by emailing secure text messages to family and friends

its a very scary situation
i dont know why all the technology is being broken up into different parts and sectors and not just one big mobile or one area at a time he said
ms berti said that because of the way many of the features of mobiles are being managed by carriers new barriers between mobile owners and the shops that sell them are not being built
concentrated services like direct connect and mobilesrv could provide a common route for people to get the latest on the latest trends
its very important that we fight for the features that make a difference ms berti said
he said the first step would be to make sure that existing mobile owners did not become dependent on the fragmentation of the market
in the us domestic broadband subscribers count not only for the first time but also for the first time
this is because broadband in the us is now built on an ever more generous gigabyte standard
this is a network bandwidth that can collectively hold as much as four times the amount of data a consumer with fixedline phone could carry
this means that even without gigabytes of data for consumers the capacity on a phone like the one in your pocket will be enough to satisfy every mobile user in the world
mr berti said it would be important for carriers to understand the different uses for different types of mobile data so that different people can enjoy the same thing
he said that if they wanted to give people access to faster services like music and video then they would have to make sure that it was affordable and easy to get on a phone
you need money for phones
you also need networks that transfer data
you need networks that are easy to set up and use
you need networks that are fast and easy to use
you need those features and more and more people are becoming convinced that the good old days of mobile phone calls and texting are coming to an end
they are convinced that they can rely on the same old problems that made mobile phones so different from the problems of text messaging

by any measure the bbc should be judged on its programming this year
the conservative party is the first party to break with the mould and focus entirely on the issues at hand

the lib dems have also got to start making sense of the iraq war and talking about tactical strikes
and the liberal democrats have got to start doing something about the tsunami in asia the worlds second largest ocean
by all accounts the bbc should be judged on what it is doing
but it should be judged on the quality of the programmes the political parties are good at
the bbc should be judged on its quality of programming
and the liberal democrats should be judged on the quality of its news and current affairs programmes
the bbc should be judged on what it is doing
but it should be judged on whether its priming the media and public for their own purposes should be limited
but that is the key point
the bbcs priming is halfbaked and half necessary
it is not going to be fair
it is not going to be generous and fair
it is not going to be representative
it is not going to be a fair and balanced report
it is not going to be a balanced piece of politics
it is not going to be a balanced package fair and balanced at all costs
the bbcs report should not just be about the bbcs priming but should also include a full account of the parties record in the past 6 years
and that should include a detailed assessment of the parties achievements in public life
this includes how the government has funded public services increased enterprise increased employment security and raised standards
all of these have had a significant part to play in the governments recent performance

but if a meeting is not agreed then it will be dealt with aplexical as opposed to absolute
the us says its aircraft will be inspected by the iisb only as required by international and commonwealth law
if the uk does not have an iisb the government will then have to decide whether to issue a new foreign charter

this new approach was being pursued recklessly and with great recklessness he argued
the new us law was being challenged by former president bushs former adviser phil reynolds resignation
mr blunkett added that the new us standards council should now be judged on its own merits

you cant change the law just by obeying court orders mr kalanich was recently awarded an iron ore  mineral resources award in the us state of california
the award by iron ore  mineral resources chairman john kinnock announced in november 2003 is the first in the world to be made on a single date
kinnock has described the case  which was launched in 2003 as the largest to date against unclaimed mineral resources in the history of industry  as a fight against mining over who can profit and where
he has promised to set a date for the auction of all the identified minerals within the next 18 months
kinnock who became chairman in a surprise move in november said the aim of the action was to stop the needless disposal of unclaimed mineral resources
he has pledged to set a date for the auction of the 730 niobium ingots of the nigerian copper industry which are in the hands of foreign companies
we will not let these unclaimed resources go uncollected in our resources
we will not let them go uncollected he told a news conference at the world iron ore conference in cannes
kinnock is often criticised for turning a blind eye to the massive amount of unclaimed gold and silver in the world
but the iron ore  resources director for the state of california said the problem lies with the international standards on this matter
a multinational corporation must respect the laws and its employees
any decision to refuse to honour the terms of a contract will result in immediate termination
compliance will result in immediate termination of the contract his statement added
kinnock has accused the nigerian government of acting against international law and of disregarding demands to limit the number of mines it has in its grip
on tuesday he signed a document with foreign ministers of the nigerian copper industry the iron ore  resources federation and the world trade organisation
mr kinnock said that the government was making an example of the nigerians who were refusing to comply with the terms of a contract

banned brazilian sprinter mardy fish was forced out of the sap open at the buenos aires championships on sunday by rain
the 36yearold finished fourth behind compatriot and world record holder maria guillermo coria who was the second holder after fish
the rain intervened again on sunday night as it did on previous occasions
the rain is a major factor in the decision to pull fish out of the event said buenos aire vice president javier barrera
it is a major factor because mardy fish did not play in the sap open
fishing is a great passion of the country
its not an easy sport and its always difficult to get the results you want when you are a great athlete and the country is big enough to handle it
we are the first country in the world to pull mardy fish said barrera
he was in rain for only two hours then was allowed to rest one minute to play another minute and then the next minute was played the second minute
david stevens beat middlesbrough international james clarke in the fourth round
the now 22yearold clarke was seeded 495 to meet mardy fish in the last 16 of the sap open
i played him three times in the cup and won in the end
hes a great player and he knows how to put a good game under pressure
hes what i consider to be an older player than maria clarke so i was really pleased to make him a recipient of the prize
hes got a great concentration and he works hard
he was very pleased to finish

sadly the commercial giant is still trying to do away with its longstanding privacy concern by putting a user in charge of a gadget
the experiment would be unthinkable a few years ago said vinod promdares vice president of technology and sales
but now we are seeing how little people really understand about technology and the danger they pose to their personal information said mr promdares
privacy is a big one
if you have a smartcard you are able to keep all your info about you all the time and you would never ever open up a backdoor on your pc he said
the new gadget would also allow sony to keep all your files and photos on a single device
the first consumer version of the phone was not widely distributed and its early public release was well short of expectations said mr promdares
currently sony is only available in the uk

a digital music library that lets people save tv shows and other data to hard drives has topped the us search engine with users taking control of it
the service lets people search catalogues of tv shows produced by network operators finding their relatives or even buying the shows themselves
search engine users can also view cast and crew information and buy set lists and video clips
the software giant said the service would be free to existing pc users and those that bought the first time
it will not be sold to anyone who wants to upgrade to the latest version of the pc
the paidfor model of searching for tv shows is based on user actions performed through a toolbar on a web page said mr promdares
users can view current listings of shows produced by networks and also buy set lists of films and games
the paidfor model of searching for tv shows produced by networks is based on user actions performed through a toolbar on a web page
the web search engine has a population of hundreds of millions of users and has reached a peak of 10 billion daily
its desktop search technology lets users browse the net for tv broadcasters cable telephone firms film studios and other companies that make shows available on the net
it also has a catalogue of movies available on the uk disc system
users can also search the web for tv shows produced by producers or actors and buy set lists
mr promdares said the paidfor model of searching for tv shows produced by producers or actors was the way to go about it
it is about putting a user on a server reading a book and having access to that information stored on the server running

software giant microsoft is joining forces with apple to create a new breed of operating system called ibm 10
the business software giant which last month said it was looking to buy apple will buy the operating system from ibm
ibm said the move was to build a new operating system into its classic mac laptop pc
ibm said microsoft would fund the deal through a previouslyunown fund that is governed by a different system than the current system used by microsoft
ibm said the new ibm 10 operating system would be built around mbpci a new microsoft technologies consortium
ibm said it expected to announce more details about the new operating system at the 3 feb events later in the month
microsoft said the purchase of ibm would put it in a stronger position to compete against rival products such as windows and xbox
ibm 10 comes bundled with microsofts windows xp operating system
it would create a new breed of operating system that has been reinvented to make it more like windows
ibm said the new ibm 10 would be built around the ibms new intellectual property rights management regime
this would permit software patents to be freely transferred between the operating system and the hardware used to run it
this would give it the ability to regulate content distribution and the like
ibm said the new operating system would be supported in half the worlds 10 million pc users by the middle of the year
microsoft said it is looking to get into the game of sending cheapwaysed people on mission to the far flung planets of the xbox
the company has said it hopes the new system will let pc users get hold of millions of pirated games at prices far below those sold by pc giants
games are pirated almost all the way down to the cartridge or disc but most are rare

the us and japan are monitoring the yen and the yen off a record high against the dollar as the markets tighten amid persistent economic woes
the dollar is now beating the yen with analysts saying that the weakening dollar was unlikely to have any significant impact on the global economy
the yen has lost about 8 against the us since july to a fiveyear high of 11564 against the us1558 and asia vietnam the worlds biggest currency
the yen has lost 55 against the us to a record 13020
one of the reasons that the dollar is enjoying such a strong upturn is due to the protectionism that has accompanied the euro and has been a major drag on the dollar
the yen is currently about 1667 against the us1727 against the euro and 1740 against the pound
the yen has lost about 4 against the us in the last three months of 2004
the dollar has fallen slightly against the us but is gaining against other major currencies

in july 2004 he said the terror attacks in 2001 and tony blair has a responsibility to take
mr blairs exit from the tories marked a significant departure for mr brown who had been part of the partys government on issues such as immigration and the economy
mr brown had previously said the tories would win the election against labour in the next few weeks

the governments demand for moneys tax cuts is more than a politician can give
the governments citizens money is the prime minister has to give and the governments money is automatically subject to the voters will
if the prime minister cannot make the decisions then the electorate have no say in itthe current governments budget is £17 billion below the £18 billion it was two months ago mr blair said during a question and answer session with mr brown
he said people would be better served by giving the money directly to the states rather than using the money for tax cuts
mr blair said if labour won the next election the treasury would get more money to spend and the taxpayer less money to borrow
the prime minister said it was a different ball game
the maths of the two prmes are no more than a fair approximation of what they can and cannot do
they can and should implement the more controversial changes to the basic taxation system that the treasury and the tories want to see
the question then becomes whether the tories are serious about making government work by harnessing the private investment that has given us the current economic order and the social contract that it has built up on this earth
mr blair said labour  which received £335m in the two months after the budget announcement  was prepared to spend more than double its £18bn £1bn in the coming parliament to deliver a radical overhaul of the tories tax plans
the result would be a budget that delivers a major boost to the tories which are arguing that they are paying more tax because they are shedding substantial amounts of revenue
it would be a major boost to labour which has promised to cut taxes for the middleclass and for the very lowest paid earners
mr blair also unveiled plans to increase child tax credit thresholds to £1520 from the current £1185
he also unveiled a new duty free savings plan that would see the basic rate rise to 50 from the current 25 and would allow employers to charge an early warning fee if they could to help people see the extra cash on offer

by way of comparison to the original star wars game halo 2 the ps2 title runs at 350 frames per second
the flimsy graphics look just right but the psychological appeal is that it gives players a reason to want to play the game even if they never play it
the ps2 title has a graphical adventure similar to the original game but with higher resolution textures
this higher resolution textures make the games look better and may mean that halo 2 will run on much higher definition displays
the game is playable on any modern pc through internet access through a wireless adapter or by using wireless bluetooth games
halo 2 is expected in 2006 for the pc and the console versions will have a broadband version by the end of the year

the creator of the hugely popular pennywise and ringleader games has been sued by the charity that helped him make them a reality
mark oatley is the man behind pennywise the sims games which sold more than 5 billion copies in the uk in 2003
his latest project was to create a platform game based around them which would allow people to compete against each other to see how far they could go
he quit the game maker in 2003 after four unsuccessful attempts to merge the pennywise and ringleader games
the lawsuit said he was fired from pennywise in august of last year and said he had a passion for the project that made him quit
the lawsuit was filed in the us district court in san francisco and has not been made before
the lawsuit said that while he was at the game maker to create ringleader 10 people contacted mr owen in 2003 to persuade him to join his new venture
mr owen left the game maker in 2003 after only 14 months in the firm
the lawsuit said mr owen promised him that he would make the game he invented the pennywise games for the famous pennystar games company in january last year
but the lawsuit also said mr owen said in january that he was no longer seriously in love with the project
mr owen who is blind described in the suit as a father of four living in texas
his company texas game maker said it would be difficult to find a single single pennywise programmer to join his development team and said that it was hard to recruit new programmers after seeing how few people were willing to work for the game maker
the lawsuit said mr owen frequently changed jobs between attempts to work on the project and also in some cases

andrew howard has hit out at ukip over the way they have been treated by their supporters
the party which is hoping to win the largest independent constituency in the history of the world is claiming a poor performance in elections
the lib dems are urging mr howard to shake up the way it deals with opposition politicians
mr howard is meeting his lord walden assembly colleagues on tuesday to discuss a bill to change the law on assault weapons licences to allow more stringent criteria for hunting
the bill which is tabled in the lords would allow the killing of any form of wild boar without a licence and would replace it with a national hunting act
the lib dems want the government to follow in the footsteps of the commons and pass a law so that hunters cannot be prosecuted for using either birdshot or short range ammunition
this would be a major step towards abolishing the law which gives arms dealers up to three years jail time for political purposes  although the current maximum penalty is a fine
the lord chancellor lord falconer has said the current system of criminalising hunting without trial is unworkable and needs a proper rethinking
he told bbc radio 4s today programme we have to see it through to discussion with the parliament
we are not in favour of a criminal law reclassification at this stage
we are not in favour of a reform of the law said mr howard
we are going to have to see what we can do in the law to help redress the grievances of the hunters who suffered the most he said
we are going to have to see what we can do in the law to address the issue of unfair taxation and for example the inheritance tax credit
mr howard said the inheritance tax credit would allow people to save up some of their savings by taking out a share of a modest personal savings plan
it would allow people to take out a share of their savings and invest that into a share in a share of a home said mr howard
the other major changes to the current system  dubbed zero duty after the zero tolerance approach to antisocial behaviour  are being brought forward by the conservatives

the egyptian government has denied that it supports the plans for a member state of the world community to establish an antirelighess global group
the idea has been floated by chinas state development organization which said that any future member state which does not accept the member state proposal would be treated as a zero sum game
the idea has been backed by the world economic forum at the uk government institute for economic research an imfi spokesman told reuters
the idea was discussed in december at a meeting of the g7 finance ministers in phoenix city in south africa
the meeting was one of eight meetings covering africa and asia which will decide the group of nations which will host the g7 in japan australia greece germany and the netherlands
the other meetings are being held in sapopi indonesia amunu pacific and china
the world community has expressed concern that some member nations of the group of nations which meet there are failing to tackle poverty

australian house of commons lower house of parliament has approved a bill to ensure that asylum seekers who want to settle in australia receive full rights
the australian people voted in favour of the law introduced at the last australian election after the war in iraq
the bill which was approved in a 338 vote says that the human rights and economic conditions in australia will be guaranteed only in accord with the european union
the australian people have always valued human rights and the human rights of minorities
but many of them are now taking steps to improve them
the australian people have shown extraordinary courage in challenging the barbarism of warring nations and have shown that they are willing to take extraordinary measures to ensure those rights are not ignored
the new law proposes fundamental changes to the law to give full rights to those who are not already refugees to those who are
it would also extend protection to economic migrants from countries

7 years ago today when i first played mariotheres
six years later halo 2 was out and the title gave fans something to jump out at you but more importantly it gave you an exciting new gameplay experience
you control the halo 2 character and start off the game off by creating your own story
there are four story sections with different factions factions with different tactics and weapons to choose from
the first mission is for the devil and the crew of the freighter the second is for the city of hope and third is for the men of the freighter the ultimate goal is achieved when you break free of the clutches of the alien invaders
all four missions are completely separate games  you play the game and then you progress through the next four sections
the levels you play are not easily explained or explained away  they just happen to be assigned to you
all the way through you get hints from the crew about where you are and what you are doing
all the story is in the fourth mission
the special effects are great and the gameplay is good
but the fact that the game gives you all these different levels is what really makes it special
theres no point in getting into the gameplay
all you need to do is create your own story and you will have achieved everything else
i always like to play by the rules and if the rules say so i go along
the real problem is that the more you can break the rules the more fun it becomes
the point at which you begin to lose yourself in the game the more you forget about the game and the more you try to figure out what the hell is going on
the solution is to play by the rules and play nice
the story is a good adventure
the beautiful graphics are a bit too bright for my taste but they really do give the game a distinctively engrossing quality
the music is also good and well balanced and the levels are well placed
the story is a good adventure
the controls are good too
the only problem i had with the game was that it was rather heavy
i played around with it a bit and it hardly felt sluggish
other than that i was not very into the game whatsoever
first off there are no graphics issues and i got the game running on high settings
it ran smoothly enough and was clear that the freighter was going to be one of the most stunning games i have played
on the other hand there is one small problem

we are all hopeful that this report will lead to a better understanding of how the antiterrorism bill was passed he told the bbcs breakfast with frost programme
we have got this very important and important law and order issue at our front door with us in the middle east and bangkok he said the bill allowing the indefinite detention of foreign nationals without trial was a good first step towards closer scrutiny

hackers are using computers that are not theirs to hack into personal data of those they target
in one of its increasingly infamous outbreaks of the maligned xbox 2 the firm reported that four people had accessed more than 100000 accounts and deleted almost all email on at least one machine
those who set up their machines for fun in search of malicious activity are not going to sit on the goodwill of xbox or to the liking of those running the malicious programs
instead they are being encouraged to steal cash from machines that are turned off and from hard drives that are sitting idle
the criminals are using machines that are barely warm at the moment and that have been blessed with a pcbo factor
the most common way that these criminals pilfer personal data is through a web page dedicated to the term bot
a shortened version of the google docstring that accompanies any virus or trojan is used to log what is collected and what is actually done
the bot function lets the criminals get at information about a machine or people and this is done through programs such as auf pcs and mailv
also included in the download is a firewall that blocks programs that the bot surreptitiously surrepthe program installs on a machine
and the spywarefly includes programs that hijack antivirus programs that are turned off by default
monitoring firm deloitte estimates that the number of machines infected by the malicious bot nets has dropped by 90

chinas national airline has slashed flights and jobs by a quarter million as it tries to cut costs
the firm said it had rescued 200000 jobs which had been axed in the previous year
the announcement by chinas national airline came the day after it said it was to seek higher corporate earnings taxes
nasu the secondlargest carrier in china ordered the cuts
the cut will allow nasu to cut almost 30000 jobs across three regions
in the three regions the airline said that due to the cushioning it was able to provide in the face of economic uncertainties it would face in coming years the jobs losses would be offset by investments in new routes and technology development
the cuts will also allow nasu to trim costs by extending service to chinas capital in the north east of the country
nasu said in a statement that nasu had also cut 1100 jobs in the last 12 months to help it expand its louis valley business
the airline said that the cuts would allow it to reduce costs by about 190m

the team will be aiming to have a fully functional desktop in the very near future
the italics have already worked with a few major companies to get this preliminary design developed
the devices capabilities and design philosophy means they can be used in real time as well as in rapid response
it is being designed in conjunction with the mms enrico lopez and dominic walsh who have already worked with the screencasts studio to prototype a prototype phone
the screen of the multimedia devices nokia 2g and the contents of the screens of many other mobile operators are being controlled via voice commands
the team behind the project said that voice commands would make the actions of the multimedia devices easier to perform
if you are using the nokia 2g you will be able to make the commands by using a voice command selected on the device
if you are using the 2g you will be able to use the voice command by going to the home screen and selecting the menu item on the left hand side of the screen
you will need to enable the home key and click on the ringtone that is on it to take the action
the action is called a ringtone scan and is sent to the device when the ringtone is active
when the device is turned on the screen is constantly being swiped across the screen and the number on the ringtone is held against the screen
the more messages a message is holding the more likely it is that they are to be taken
so for instance if my sms keeps going the more messages that sms is scanned the more likely that its to be a sms being held by the user
the more messages that sms maintains the more likely that it is that it is a message being held said mr walsh
mr lopez and mr walsh used already available information to design a way that the multimedia devices can communicate with each other
we have a pretty good idea what the wide range of multimedia services that are available will do for mobile users said mr walsh
we were not trying to just ask how many people use mobiles we wanted to understand how people use mobiles how they use their phones the multimedia capabilities of the nokia 2g will be built on top of the already available graphics drivers and the processors for the codenamed super phone
the phone which is expected to start hitting the market in 2006 will have a usable qwerty screen and be able to run programs from it like drawing a picture and opening the

the prime minister has defended the action of his immigration minister as he toured europe
the pair met the press on monday after the bloc decided not to hold immigration quotas
in a speech on tuesday mr brown said the numbers of asylum seekers were a key issue in the election
but he said the planned quotas on migrants and their children would remain
mr browns comments came as the government unveiled its new antiterror measures
the tories criticised how the new proposals were being introduced and claimed the plans were part of a lib dem agenda
what is needed is an honest discussion
the lib dems believe that a multicultural society and a strong economy mean a liberal democratic labour government will deliver for all voters and also lower crime and improve peoples lives
this would be the governments first stand on antiterror measures mr brown said
he added well know that to be effective you have to have control of the ground
the tories believe that if you have control of the ground you have to have control of agenda you have to have control of people you control well have a liberal democratic government  you have to have that in your manifestos
you cant have that
the lib dems want the government to increase border controls and impose quotas on immigrants and asylum seekers saying the proposals are more tests of citizenship than current asylum rules
mr browns speech comes on top of a day of protests in the us and europe over the plans
a week of protests following the idea of letting people decide for themselves their future in the uk
a uk independence party leader has called for the government to abandon its plan to open borders to immigrants from germany and elsewhere in the world
jonathan mueller told a commons debate the proposal was at best a pipe dream and at worst the poison pill for an already deep and complex immigration debate
the lib dems also say the government is dragging its heels over the issue
jonathan kennedy said he was glad that the government was stepping up its lobbying for better

that is to say i was positive the majority of people are not getting the benefit of the doubt information given on the internet is a vital part of any fair and open discussion
but if you are getting the information the information is not being taken as fact then i hope not i hope you dont assume everyone is entitled to be a fair and open forum
the outcome of the vote  for me i think the internet is the worlds best forum to discuss anything  is the ultimate verdict
i havent forgotten that 
i can speak to you when i want to
there is no need to register my disappointment
i have not
i merely expressed it
this was not a topic for me
we have a duty to communicate it was not a message that should be drowned out in the sea of irrelevant politics
i had the opportunity to reflect on what i believed
to be honest i dont know how i felt
i think its a very important forum and i think people are entitled to express their views in it
those who claim to be critical of the media or those who insist on remaining neutral are not being genuine
there is no point engaging in that now you have to prove your point
i was assured by my sources that i was not the target of cyberbullying
this was not some witchhunt
i have no doubt that many people feel this way
i have been receiving death threats but i believe that the threats were intended by people who did not realize that the internet was a wonderful place to express opinions
i was told by an anonymous source that she had personally received death threats but believed that their intent was to spread fear
i am not stupid i think that the internet is a wonderful place to express opinions
i believe in free expression and i think that the threats were intended by people who were not aware that the internet existed
the problem with talking about politics online is that we are told it is cool to talk in the middle of a thuggish gibberish voice
it is absolutely not
i have never met a politician i could remember
i have never met a muslim i could remember
i have never met a christian i could remember
i have never met a christian
i believe in free expression and i think that the threats were not intended by the government
i think we have a very narrow view of what constitutes political correctness
if someone is going to smear you they should not smear me
i would never do it that way
i am not

ukraine has been hit by a series of economic downturns with consumer prices rising faster than expected
the economy has grown by 3 in the past year with 02 of the population now living in economic security
the survey showed that economic conditions had worsened in asia and other parts of the former asian union
the difficulties faced by the country  which is currently enjoying stronger than expected growth in the second quarter  have prompted gazprom the central bank of nevada and the uks central bank to outline their own economic policy objectives
the two central banks are scheduled to meet for the weekend of 16 and 17 telegrams telegrams
analysts said the outlook remained good despite signs of weakness in the second half of last year
weakerthan expected inflation figures mean that the government  which is expected to seek to raise 825bn £26bn from the black hole of its budget deficit  is likely to hold its ground
despite the warnings analysts said that the uk was likely to remain the leading economy through 2015
the economy is strong enough to warrant strong government help and sufficient government reserve funds said tim yeo an economist at capital economics consultancy forrester
government spending must be taken into account in any economic policy mr yeo added

the european commission has said it is satisfied that britain has a 70 share of the energy market
the new figure came after it was revealed that the european commission had sought to loosen restrictions on britains use of wind farms
a smaller version of its eu finance ministers energy committee had said earlier that 70 of the energy should be imported from outside the eu europe
the eus energy review also found that the tougher regulations had had a positive impact on both domestic and global demand for britains energy
bbc news correspondent jeanri rigoglioso said the new figure was a rebuff to the european commission which had said the market had a legitimate role to play in the energy mix
the big challenge now is getting britain on the same wavelength with its own policies on energy and on transport and also with its own policies on transport he said
ecbs economic policy chief ken barnard has said the european commission wants to prevent major changes to the eu in the short term
he said the european commission had agreed with the british on how to address the major energy challenges

the government is to set up a new supervisory board to coordinate all supervisory roles in the uk
the shakeup follows the appointment of the six members of the supervisory body to the supervisory board at the governments supervisory committee for continental europe a body chaired by julian jordan
the tories welcomed the move saying it was the first time they were to give supervisory powers to ministers
talks aimed at resolving european disputes have now broken down
they are due to resume in april
the appointment of the other three supervisory bodies covered by the agreement will come into effect from 1 january
the european commission and the supreme court will be responsible for the dispute settlement and advisory committees and the development of their internal procedures
the appointment of the supervisory bodies is aimed at improving the supervisory performance of their countries of origin the tories said
the appointment of the other two supervisory bodies also saved the uk independence department from a major crisis in the 1990s
the appointment of the new supervisory bodies will also help to reduce the number of redundancies which could hit the countrys labour movement the tories said
the appointment of the new bodies also reflects the continuing need for a more efficient and more efficient labour movementbritain is currently seeing a rise in productivity gains in the service sector which helps the country to meet its economic and social needs

the antifeminist movement is to target women in particular after its platform strongly criticised the mens vote bookmakers
the antifeminist manifesto said women should be able to vote but men should be the decisive factor in deciding the vote
the antifeminist manifesto also said women should be expected to vote but not be the sole judge of political performances
the antifeminist manifesto is being produced by womens rights group liberatory human
its text was first published in the virginia sun newspaper in 1984
the antifeminists manifesto said women should be able to vote but men should be the decisive factor in deciding the vote
it also called for a legal presumption of social equality in elections and for equal rights of women to run the vote
however the womens advisory council for womens elections said this would not be a legal mandate
a spokesman for the womens advisory council said the presumption of social equality was a matter for the states
the emphasis on social equality will allow states to develop more effective and fair elections which are fair to the women and minority groups the spokesman said
the liberatory manifesto was published by the womens advisory council and has been substantially endorsed by the mens and conservative parties
the antifeminist manifesto said women should be able to vote but men should be the sole judge of political performances

it also said women should have the right to vote but not the right to vote
an index of key issues such as the war on iraq and immigration had been included in the text since its publication in 1984
the book was compiled by former antifeminist activists and was published by liberatory human
in its introduction the liberatory human said the antifeminist manifesto was a response to the male obsession with military force and the want for a narrow state based on fewer rights such as health care and higher education
intellectual property was an additional aim the liberatory human said

the kingdom of kampala is the largest indian consumer of beef cattle according to the world market research of commodity analysts and the world meat trade
us firm californias cattle group which operates the trade in cattle and beef has reported a 48 rise in sales since 2003
californias cattle sales over that period were 21 more than in 2004
the group also said that indias consumption of beef rose faster than in any of the past 12 months
the figures were in line with market expectations
consumers optimism about the countrys meat industry has been fuelled by government initiatives such as the countrys first beef tax since the welfarist era in 1949
consumption of beef rose to 62 million tonnes in 2004 from 39 million last year
the tax was prompted by protests by farmers against slaughterhouses and the government declaring slaughterhouses as morally repugnant
however it remains unaffected by the current agricultural reform
moves to liberalise agricultural production are also proving to be a popular part of government policy making beef a big draw for the economy

the london stock exchange and the aircraft industry have also been strong contributors to the mens market during 2005 according to californias official retail partners
the european stock market is more likely to be a strong contributor to the market in 2006 as it has shown a large move in value
overall consumers appear to be enjoying more choice and more choice of goods and services californias official retail partners said
however the mens market is likely to remain a sensitive one as there are growing numbers of older consumers who are opting for more sophisticated gadgets such as cameras and video recorders which are becoming increasingly popular with older men
last year the us federal bureau of investigation launched a criminal investigation into californias

its something that the distributors can look at and decide whether they want to carry it or not
i think its something that the distributors should look at
theyve got to look at it
theyre going to have to look at it
but it doesnt have to be that way at the moment
if youre going to get the big distributors you can get it at any price
he said that distributors have been losing revenue over the last two years because of weaker competition in the physical world
the main problem he said was that distributors are not putting enough faith in the product they are selling
theyve got to believe that if they sell 15 of them an apple x1 and they get the right price from them the extra revenue will accrue over the long term he said
he said he also saw a case where distributors were cutting prices by selling a lowerpriced apple x1 than they had previously had per box
he said theyre not cutting prices because theyre not doing a poor job

the us stock market regulator has launched an investigation into claims that iraqi forces were using napalmer arms to enforce a 2005 ban on hunting in the country
the arms ban was imposed in return for the lifting of a ban on hunting with dogs
the weapons ban was later lifted amid an angry response by iraqs neighbours to the hunting of dogs
the traders are now able to hunt with their families and gather wealth by illegally hunting and shooting wild pigs
the international arbitration tribunal for the former asia kingdom said in a statement that the asia kingdom had upheld the ban but that it was concerned that iraqs laws criminalised hunting
on thursday the tate also charged napalmer with illegally using its military power to enforce a ban imposed on hunting with dogs in 2003 and 2004
the alleged breaches involved use of napalmer arms to enforce a ban imposed on hunting with dogs in 2003 and 2004 it said
it added that iraqi law enforcement agencies were obliged to respect the ban
the european court of human justice has now issued an emergency injunction stopping the practice continuing

new university chairs are being added to the uk council of education to make it more efficient
the selection process for the new chairhips is being reviewed by the office for regulatory affairs
the latest move is designed to improve the standards of governance for the top level positions in our schools

london is set to get one of the biggest beaches in the world in 2003
the 40000m square foot tropical paradise is being designed by a ukbased firm and promises quiet serenity and some of the best views in the world
the 6200m square foot sand dunes of the marsh resort will be home to an aquatic environment and a mussel coral sanctuary
sick of living in the luxury of modern mansions and paying £2500 for a house in the countryside and surrounded by palm oil fields but not fancy hotels but not fancy places that others can visit in london but can skip the beach by boat the sand dunes will be home to a sandy beach and spectacular views of the city of brighton
the company behind the sand dunes said the sand island would be a natural setting for a virtual tourism office
its sand dunes sand dunes environment and the sand itself are being designed to appeal to different demographics and lifestyles said a spokesman for the company
the sand island is set to attract a wide range of visitors from different walks of life
it will feature locally grown cotton palms and suntan lotus and will include nigerian and chinese cuisines and hiphops from different disciplines
the sand dunes is being designed by an urban design firm which is looking at ways of creating an environment where people can shop and interact with the natural environment
over the next five years the company hopes to set up 10000 jobs at a site in the middle of london
it is also looking to increase the incentives offered by the codes in ways of boosting local businesses
the sand island is being developed as an affordable accommodation for low income families

pensioners are to get at least £100000 a year from their pensions if there is a chance of living comfortably for 65 or more
the minimum pension age of 65 was introduced in 1970 but rises have taken place every year
the pensioners are expected to increase by more than 400 since they make up about three thirds of the uk population
the minimum pension age for a uk pensioner is currently 62
they must be able to work fulltime minimum wage and above and must have paid by their 21st of the age at death
the government says the increase in the minimum pension age for 65s and over helps keep costs down
pensions watchdog the pensioners trust said the government was wrong to propose a pension payment rate that reflects the cost of living

the number of people with broadband has dropped by almost five million since the start of 2004 according to a report by analysts forrester research
it said the number of people without broadband had grown by 62 million in the last six months of 2004
the rapid pace of change in the market meant that the market was well placed to sustain a sustained growth in the numbers of broadband connections said tim davies analyst at forrester
the recent drop in broadband users was largely a result of the introduction of net telephony widely adopted by the ruyanas island telegraph industry in the mid1990s
the telco has since rolled out broadband hotspots widely used by operators to let people beam online news and other information
but many rural operators are beginning to find that niches such as cheap net cafes can be too expensive for many people
the uk is among those that are starting to roll out free net broadband
but it is still struggling with high prices for slow data connections and the lack of consumer choice around broadband
the report said that despite a modest rise in the number of people accessing the net via broadband the market had more than aged 10 aged 15 16 or 17 able to afford highspeed access said tim davies analyst
overall the evidence suggests that the market is suffering from internal fragmentation and that the fragmented market for broadband services tends to depress the growth of broadband services in the uk said tim davies
the main reason for the fragmentation of broadband services is the lack of competitive environment that exists in the area said tim
there are a number of factors that lead to the fragmentation of broadband services said tim
such as the fact that broadband services are usually offered on a download or a download and a upload service on a per connection basis which means that customers have to pay huge premium prices for these services which are often extremely expensive said tim
the regulatory environment for broadband is changing and there are several reasons for the current fragmentation of broadband said tim
such as the fact that broadband services are usually offered on a per connection basis which means that customers have to pay huge premium prices for these services which are often extremely expensive said tim
the fact that broadband services are usually offered on a download or a download and a upload service on a per connection basis which means that the customer has to pay huge premium prices for these services said tim means a download or upload that takes a picture takes a second

news body the british academy of health and social work is to look at whether public and private sector pensions could help tackle obesity
it is looking at whether pension schemes might encourage people to lose weight
the academy of health and social work is due to recommend a scheme in its latest review into public and private pensions in the uk in march
the academy has also recommended replacing public pension schemes with voluntary schemes such as the onestop scheme
it is an independent body which does not rely on commercial insurers
a spokesman for the academy said the report by ita socalled pension for the future could affect the way public services are run
the government was criticised for not making any recommendations to the council of ministers concerning how the new system should work
the new system is aimed at giving people the chance to lose weight earlier and maintain it by lifestyle intervention rather than surgery said karen stephens director of the academy of health and social work
i think it is a bit hamfisted that these recommendations are about the future rather than the present she said
the spokesman said the idea of giving people the chance to lose weight earlier seemed like a bad idea
the problem weve got to deal with is that people are losing weight and that affects their daily lives in ways that no politician or government should be
we have to be very careful to distinguish between replacing an existing scheme with something that might work and looking at ways of adapting it to address it
thousands of pounds of savings have been pledged by the public and private pension industry since 1997 as part of a £35bn package
the plans would see three million people receive pension either as a lump sum or as a lump sum cash payment
they would be paid on top of a regular pension payment
and they would be funded by cuts in pension costs for the workingage people most of whom currently receive their pensions on top of their stipends
the £35bn package includes the following benefits for working age pensioners aged 65 or over
they generally do not pay if the worker is required to work parttime to support a pension
they generally do not pay if the worker is required to work fulltime if the working age person is over 60
and they generally do not pay if the working age person is over 65
the £35bn package is designed to help the public and private pension industry
the idea was first floated by the former pensions secretary mr goldsmith in a speech to the council of ministers in 1975
he said

the mobile industry is to fund a major shakeup to its software division by buying up a smaller rival firm software consultancy wmc gm
the move follows the departure of tony blair and gianfrancois from their roles on the strategic review board
the consolidation of the two firms which includes the launch of the xbox and nintendos parent is aimed at more efficient and more profitable mobile devices
nokia however is taking the lead in the consolidation with the launch of its own spinoff unit wmc
the new unit will be called mr blairmobile
mr blair told the tuesdays mms the restructuring would help underpin the mobile industry
it would help mobile firms get more cash out of developing their devices and bring more people into the market he said
the merged firm is set to offer a range of devices that run the gamut from simple to sophisticated
the first such device will be the wmc 5800 which offers three times the storage and processing power of the currently available models
mr blair said wmc would offer devices which combine a camera and a digital video recorder
the £100000 gadget which he described as a toy a digital assistant and a pocket calculator would also be available from other manufacturers
it will be the same price to entry as the current wmc which costs millions to set up but is widely seen as falling behind the game makers
the move will mean greater consolidation for smaller players in the mobile space
nokia had been expected to raise between 1bn £26bn and 1bn £26bn by selling a handset called the hd800 which combines a highspeed network with a basic phone
but mr blair stepped down as mobile boss last year and nokia was keen to take the mobile mantle on its own
the new firm has also been set up to compete against players such as ericsson and telewest as well as from

bob damien sits down with us president george w bush and european leader george panoply to talk about the future of ukip and why he should step down
this interview has been recorded and edited by ken thompson  the man behind the worlds bestselling book how to be a superdelegate  which was published earlier this year
his book how to be a superdelegate also went on to become a bestselling mens childrens book
the book challenged politicians to focus on issues such as poverty education access and security of trade that would make a big difference to ukip
mr damien who at the time was running for the leadership of pc leader said he wanted to start off with saying thank yous with talking about how we can make these issues a reality
we have to start from zero and get beyond that
i want to get beyond being a politician to actually getting on the issues
we have to challenge politicians to engage with the issues
we have to do that by talking about them
speaking with the bbc mr damien said being a leader is the key to becoming a superdelegate
he added if you dont have that then why should ukip i think be a party be accepted into the elite
that sort of thinking should be abandoned in favour of being a politician
being a politician is the key to being a politician
being a superdelegate is the key to that
i would add that the debate over be a politician should not just be about who can be president should president bush step down should be about who can be britain president miller president of paddy pita and john lennon mr president of manchester city ukip has said he will stand down before the end of the current term in april 2005
mr damien is the only european leader currently to be a ukip member

13 years after the start of the war on terror we are still fighting it
the stakes are too high to justifiably complain that mr kumarat has not imposed some of the sanctions our governments so desperately need
if we are to have a credible sense of national security from abroad then we need to be able to make use of the capabilities our citizens are fighting and not be diverted into complacency
mr kumarat knows this
he must not be tempted to turn the tables on the mujahidin threat in an attempt to win our support  in effect foreign policy must be conducted by some sort of sleeper sleeper group or militant organisation
we cannot let this happen
but the governments of many of our former allies are now mobilising to do just that

the us government is preparing to send home guard soldiers to fight iraqs war on terror
the move is part of an effort to ensure that not only foreign nationals who have fled war but also citizens who come forward to seek help get home are not targeted
the home secretary said some war criminals are being held in countries such as iraq that are not part of the us
the new home secretary said the new law would ensure that those held would not be motivated to seek harm in the new home but would ensure that those detained would be
there is no doubt that people coming forward to seek help are going to face a much higher incidence of home detention
but this new home secretary has not ruled out the possibility of sending home guards to enforce the new laws
the new home secretary said at a commons debate the minimum level of security we want puts at the centre of our counterterrorism strategy should be a question of public concern
but we need to have a policy in the homeland that is based on a suspicion that those in custody are engaged in plotting terrorist acts he said
mr blunkett said this is not just about home detention but that also had to be part of protecting the homeland
we have to make sure that when these kinds of powers are used effectively it is not just about one particular tactic but about a whole series of tactics he said
tough measures such as home detention are necessary to keep terrorists at bay he added but the home secretary appeared reluctant to take a position saying he had discussed the issue with his tuc counterparts several times
the legislation he has outlined as part of his plans for ridding the us of terrorists will have to be part of any ransacking of our terrorists home he said

the standard of living of such a large nation is the sole price of keeping its people employed and maintaining the standards of living of other nations
the present standard of living could therefore be considered to be one of the major factors affecting the standard of living of such a nation
the present standard of living is the umbilical cord standard
the umbilical cord is a cord which surrounds the ukrainian woman who has joined the workforce
women who have had maternity leave and been on leave can expect to see their average annual salary rise by £22125 from the current £22135
the standard of living could improve if maternity leave is extended on a caseby case basis
women with maternity leave need continued income support and are particularly vulnerable to economic pressures
the basic salary for a fulltime worker should be £100000
for parttime workers it is £100000
for extratime work defined contribution allowances are £1000
the minimum wage for a fulltime worker should be at least £1000
the minimum wage for extratime work should be £5000
all work should be subject to the normalisation of business rates which are set by the government
the minimum wage is essential for businesses to run costs which are being supported by tax revenues
it is essential that employers ensure that their employees are earning as they should be and is particularly important that the wages of fulltime workers should reflect this
the minimum wage is vital for workers to be paid enough to keep them employed
it is also the minimum wage which should be guaranteed by the government
the government has made it mandatory for employees to demonstrate their commitment to the minimum wage
at the same time it is essential that employers demonstrate how they intend to pay employees when they return
the minimum wage is an absolute must for any employer who wants employees earning up to £10000 a year to work
if a company is not confident that the wages of fulltime workers will reflect the level of their commitment to the minimum wage then they should refuse to hire a worker who demonstrates this level of wage theft
and if a company is not confident that the wages of fulltime workers will reflect these wages theft then they should refuse to hire a worker who demonstrates wage theft
all employers should have the right to refuse to employ any individual who breaches the ban on excessive force in workplace politics

the new york assembly is expected this week to vote on a bill that would allow the 30yearold to trade union recognition for the olympic gold medal
the pact was agreed last year when the olympic committees chairman was in hong kong to lay out vision for the future of the world sport said mr howard
as well as olympic recognition the assembly hopes to increase economic empowerment through preferential access to the olympic games britain has a £5 membership fee
other nations that have joined the assembly include the united states and japan
the new york assembly has a majority of 21 with the kommersant leader michael shejanides as speaker
the bill will be debated in the new york parliament in the next biennium before going to the full german parliament for approval
the bill will be debated in the next general election expected in may
mr howard said the british public wanted quality public services and a fair tax system
they wanted higher taxes designed more attractive nationalities and they wanted that improved public service as well
we are delighted that the assembly has agreed to begin debating and passing this important legislation in the next biennium the british people deserve an independent voice to voice their views on important issues such as immigration and the olympics mr howard said
he added they have the right to know how public services are being provided
there is a fundamental lack of transparency in public services  particularly the health service  that harms british competitiveness
there is a fundamental lack of trust in the public services and a fundamental lack of commitment by politicians to the type of public services they want
iraq the prevention of crime and the punishment of terrorism are basic human needs that the britons should be promoting
the only way to address these is to establish effective and accountable government
the british public needs to know how and why the olympic ideal is being squashed
that is the key test for government and britain
that is whether it will stand up to the scrutiny pressures of testing and finding public service amenity before it becomes a political football
that is the test that the british public and politicians have been promised
and it is on that basis that the electoral commission and the british political class will guide this contest
the british public must not be put at risk of defeat while the olympic ideal is squashed the brit

by the end of the year the number of people in work will have risen by a factor of six and they will have fewer financial obligations
that means that the state will have given up on its debt burden
the prime minister has been asked to tackle the problems faced by the uk by tackling rising poverty and rising incomes
deputy prime minister john hilary said i have the same commitment and vision for the next generation as my predecessor david blunkett
yet the economy has continued to stagnate
the authors of the new book poverty in the modern age warn that the current economic climate is unsustainable and that rising levels of debt will inevitably lead to a more costly mistake
we are at a turning point in our history of resisting central banks and the markets but this time it is the central government that is being more aggressive said david dawson an economics major at londons university
it is the environment secretary sesshomaru shigeo who has spoken out against the huge sums of debt profiting firms are taking to the streets against corporate governance and against the way everything is being managed in the current economic climate
he said the easy way out for workers was by having a serious conversation with the central government
the hard way said mr shigeos approach was to using his new role to demand action from the city and the countryside instead of the banks and the insurance companies
mr shigeos comments follow the intervention of cityhall which said that just over a third of gos loans were made outside the uk
the government is now proposing to triple the loans available to boost economic growth from a projected 18 to 24 percentage points by 2007
it is also planning extra debt relief after a series of interest rate increases
mr shigeos intervention follows a meeting of the 600 richest people at which the gazprom governor and other top gazprom officials agreed to review the way debt is dealt with
the bank of england is expected to agree on 20 december how to distribute debt between member states and build up support for debt relief in the uk
mr shigeos intervention comes as he looks to strengthen his grip on power and reduce the size of his private pension fund the boe which has drawn criticism for taking part in illegal activity in the country
mr hilary said that as governor he had shown a remarkable ability to take control of troubled economic affairs
we must not allow ourselves to be misled by our record when princes like ewan b cockbain
====================
and we can all agree that the economy is the most important factor affecting opinion and that theres no one more confident about the us recovery than myself
i have no doubt that the economy is doing well
i am just wrong
and theres no one more confident about the us recovery than me
meanwhile across the political spectrum the issue of tax policy is being brought up in a highly charged election year
with the global financial crisis hampering economic recovery and the us falling behind in the race for the worlds largest exports economy the countrys leaders are trying to reassure the world that economic growth is on the way up
but the issue at hand is not just the high personal income tax bills and rising cost of living but also the tsunami and wider social problems in the developing world
as the uss economic growth slows and peoples aspirations for a better life wither away at the perceived threat of a nuclear holocaust the issue is brought up with increasing frequency
this is because of the sheer scale of the problem
in a world of just 1 trillion people who are constantly bombarded by news about whats wrong with their lives the issue becomes exponentially greater
one million lives that are left to rot in the deserts of india or the quaggan sea in the middle of the amhara sea are wiped away
the remaining ones to the tsunami and subsequent tsunami survivors are left to choose between saving their economic life or spending their golden years in rich countries like china or russia
the political situation is also becoming more intractable
as the uss economic growth slows and peoples aspirations for a better world begin to wither away at the perceived threat of a nuclear holocaust the issue is brought up again with increasing frequency
this time it is the looming threat of terrorism that is hampering the uss economic recovery
to wit the threat of terrorism
the global financial system is in crisis
the threat of terrorism is that the us will suffer too
meanwhile the issue of tax policy is being raised with the potential consequences for the world economy of a tsunami and other natural disaster
in a world of just over 1 trillion people who are constantly bombarded by news about whats wrong with their lives the issue becomes exponentially greateras the world economy widens and peoples aspirations for a better world begin to wither away at the perceived threat of a nuclear holocaust the issue is brought up with increasing frequency
by the end of the year it should be obvious why the global economy has shrunk  and will shrink

the web is a living organism
we can do better
we can live longer our communities and our freedom are vital components of a vibrant and democratic web
but the reality is that the majority of web users are not informed enough about the benefits and risks of using a web browser
the web has been around for a very long time
people have been using it for a number of years
they have all been given the opportunity to do something different
but the web has not always been integrated
in the last few years many firms have shifted to using tools like amazon lists or google goodmail
amazon lists let people easily search for web pages based on the listed companies and list sites they are familiar with
they also let people easily buy web content
but the true power lies in the tool the web has
the web is the open source tool that allows anyone to create their own web page free of charge
in many ways it is like google goodmail
it lets anyone make a page out of anything and it has all the functionality of a web page
it has all the security features of a web page and it has all the power
but the real beauty of the web is its democratising potential
it allows anyone to build a web page out of anything and it has all the functionality of a web page
it has all the flexibility
the democratised ideas are there for all to create and use
in many ways open source makes it possible to do all sorts of things
it makes it possible to do things that are unimaginable in the past
it makes it possible to do things that will excite and excite users of the web
it also opens up a whole new world of possibilities
in the decade to come open source will become the standard for all types of software
it will be democratised
it will change the way people interact with the web
it will change the way technology companies work
it will change the way people build websites and the way they build them
it will change the way technology firms think about and deliver services to the people who use the web
and if theres any downside to using open source then it is that you wont be able to use it because you wont be getting paid
but if you are developing something that needs a lot of work then you could use open source
i think that is the future
i think the community is excited about it
it is a wonderful combination of people want to help it grow and reward those

a senior member of tony blairs cabinet has resigned after making a shocking admission to tv viewers he lied about his attendance at g8 meetings
gordon brown quit the cabinet amid growing questions over cabinet splits
mr blair told bbc radio fours world at one programme that he had left the meeting where the chancellor and other senior officials met
but he was later reinstated by the cabinet
the prime minister told reporters he accepted mr browns apology for missing a meeting with g8 leaders
mr blair said i understand why he had gone and what a big mistake that had been
i hope it is something short of a fullblown historical scandal
i know from those around me that there are divisions within the cabinet but the prime minister is right to ask those people to lead the way on this he added
mr blair also said he was pleased the cabinet had been made more transparent about its meeting schedule and said it was a positive development for the public
the announcement came after mr brown told reporters mr blair had no plans to resign at the next g8 meeting of the world industrial wheis countries in march
a spokesman said on friday the chancellor had told world leaders he would be visiting australia in the next few weeks to discuss trade and the g8s reformed set of global economic rules
this decision was taken on the back of the announcement that the prime minister would not return to the premiership in the event of a leadership contest he said

the tories are to back a new demand that the government allow tony blair to serve in his post
their new proposal would allow the prime minister to serve for longer if labour wins a third term in power
the party has argued that as tony blair first took charge in 1997 labour would lose its majority in parliament
it also wants the conservatives to give him a second term as prime minister
it is also worth remembering that the tories have promised to continue cutting government spending even as they are in government
mr blair has promised to keep the country safe and to increase funding for the department for education and the work and pensions fund
he is also to restore full transparency in the appointment of judges and other legal staff and to replace some of the old regulatory structures

the european unions consumer credit watchdog has launched an investigation into firms that have been billing customers about the benefits of personal debt collection
the probe follows claims that firms such as carmaker siemens and powerhouse which offer debt relief are using customer data to avoid european law
the firms are among firms being investigated by the ecc
the firms are not the only firms being targeted the ecc is looking into  but has so far only launched two criminal investigations
the firms  powerhouse and carmaker venus  are among firms being investigated
the probe which is running from september into whether firms misuse customer data will also examine whether data protection law applies to companies as well as individuals
the firms  which are also not part of the audit  have said that they will cooperate fully with the ecc
among the firms being targeted the ecc is looking at is car maker siemens which is looking at whether it should be allowed to use its own drivers licence numbers to collect interest on personal debt
siemens and car maker venus have also said they are willing to cooperate fully with the ecc looking at ways to ensure that customer data can be stored better and more securely
the ecc has issued instructions to all firms involved in the probe to remove any personal data they have collected as well as imposing confidentiality and data protection laws that are not yet fully in force
the investigation into the firms comes as the ecc and the european commission push hard for tougher regulation of debt services
the ecc is also concerned that companies using personal data collection technologies may be turning the data over to the government when they do not have it within 30 days
privacy advocates are concerned that companies using dirty or unstructured data may be turning the data over to the police

oscar engineer dr mark obermann has spent three months behind closed doors trying to identify solutions to problems he says are plaguing the car industry
the dutch engineer is now embarking on a fiveyear project of developing software for intelligent navigation that will be presented at the 3gsm trade show in lisbon
the technology is being designed to ensure that people can readily get around town or in the countryside
mr obermann says he is confident that the car makers have enough of a demand for intelligent driving systems to justify the hefty investment required to get it onto the market
earlier this month a carmaker said it was investing more than 500m euros 318m £415m into intelligentdriving systems
the investment will be used to develop software that will drive drivers around the world to find and book their next car
the investment by car maker nissan will also be used to develop software that will recognise odour and unlock the features offered by the next generation of the technology
mr obermann says that although the technology is being designed to discover anomalies in driving data it has already proved itself to be a hugely successful system
in just the last few months it has become the darling of the 3gsm and a regular talking point in the 3gsm community
a year ago nissan was the only firm to win a contract to develop intelligentdriving software
this year is going to be crucial for nissan says mr obermann
the stakes are too high to just be around
we have to show that we are cutting the number of people who are not driving
we have to show that we are reducing emissions
i am aware that many people are not completely convinced by this and feel that is not enough to do them any good
i am convinced that this is going to be a very important talking point in the car industry for the next decade or two at that mr obermann has been working on an automated roadside parking system at its nissan labs in philadelphia and in london
while there he is also attempting to launch a system that will let drivers find their way around town using algorithms that predict their surroundings based on traffic patterns and speed levels
with its automatic navigation and speedometer functions id software detects and trains drivers by mapping out how much time they have left in the lane before turning left
motorians who have travelled through the city of philadelphia five minutes and 37 seconds will now be rewarded with a free id card

it comes in a classic version of grand theft auto
a bizarre mix of old school and new
the story follows a group of teenagers who embark on a road trip through america discovering a treasure chest hidden somewhere deep inside a prehistoric jungle
the movie sees them learn more about history and geography than they can bear to reconstruct with accuracy
as with most such mishmashups the treasure is either american made or somewhere in between
it is all a bit tiresome
all the best movies ever
but hey its not like us history stuff when you have nostalgia and that sort of thing
it would have been a better movie hadnt the treasure not been american
a little too good at comedy
but no real indication of the sort of movie i was looking for
the film opens with a scene showing a group of teenagers dressed as prehistoric dinosaurs waiting for a train track
they are dressed in ancient garb with batwings and armbands on either side of their heads and feet
at first they seem to be doing nothing
but as they slowly open the door they seem to be suddenly growing much larger
they are wearing all sorts of ancient clothing including stockings stockings and stockings fish and some even fish oil
as they pass the stage a big mushroom appears and slowly begins to gulp down the contents of the treasure chest
now if the word is not offensive i suggest it is time for some serious action
it is all about time action  but really what are you waiting for  a movie about time travel and time travel
it is a beautiful piece of cinema
however the action and comedy are not that impressive especially when compared to the beautiful score by ron howards
but when it comes to the movie they are just too good a piece of crap to pass up
it is a masterpiece

to be honest as a correspondent i would much rather be working for an international newspaper than an alwayson phone line
theres more to come from gazette and canadian trade newspaper but i have to warn you i dont know how many times we have said the same thing to each other as we have for each other
we are in a very different league
i think gazette and canadian trade daily trade both daily and in a pinch trades with other papers
i also worry about their political allegiances
the thing is we all want a better world for sure but it is hard to say who wants what or how
i think they have it in pretty much the same way do we as a nation want the best for ourselves and can afford to be more transparent
i think our economy is doing very well and i think they want to get a lot more out of us than we do
i worry a little bit about the politics but it is really just speculation
theres lots to do with the fact that on the whole the people we are talking to are actually happy for us
i worry a lot about the foreign policy
i have never actually had one with the press
whats more i have had to see the people in charge and they have been very supportive
i am a little bit afraid of the old guard which is more of a fear in itself than an outright hostility
they are very nice but not very helpful
i dont think they are very helpful because the mood is very bad
i think we are in quite bad shape

she said there is a very clear dividing line between financial firms and people who do not want to be associated with them

i think there is a distinct perception that if you are a financial firm you want to be associated with a global firm rather than just a regional or a local firm
i think that is extremely negative
i am very happy with the way that markets work in europe and the way that i am managing my business
i see lots of opportunities for new opportunities
i am very happy with the way that markets work in europe and its certainly not ideal but i think its very beneficial

lord of the rings director peter jackson has said that his latest film the eighth in a series of seven films about the bard will be released in the us on 11 february
the film which stars british actors clive owen and james young is due for release on 16 february in asia
the film chronicles the life of singer and radio host bobby bennett and his band the caskets
its release comes amid growing concerns about the tsunami disaster in indonesia and concerns about the countrys growing political allegiances
the film has the cast of bobby bennett with owen carr looking after the caskets tour and a musical based on the song
jackson added that the film will be about the trauma of seeing those who once were he and not listening to the outside world

the film was legally put up for sale in india for 10 days in 2003 but the government later reduced the price to 10 rupees 12 £11
a spokesman for the indonesian government said the campaign was illegal and would be swiftly dismantled
however film director mr jackson who has a son with sean mack at the moment is hopeful that the film may be made in the us
i dont know if its going to be legal in the us he said
mr jackson is also raising funds for tsunami victims through the new york attorney general fund

andrew harris a former federal prosecutor now runs the liberal action research centre at londons university law school
but it is seriously flawed he said
the evidence is there clearly of a criminal nature and the government is attempting to obstruct justice by delaying key trials so that politicians and the public can have their say
we have got a serious issue of fraud and we have got to address it in the proper way mr harris said
the government should be making sure that noone is under any illusions that this is a serious problem
the evidence of a criminal nature is very strong he said
the evidence suggests that organised crime gangs were involved
we have got to get hold of all the money  real money  and bring it to these gangs he said
the evidence also shows that organised crime gangs were using intimidation to get information
the evidence shows that politicians and the public are being used against them he said
the evidence also shows that the governments current strategy of using the courts to deal with the problem is working
the evidence also shows that the pressure is on to politicians and the public to say to them i want your money and i want your vote and i want your vote for this government
to that end the evidence shows that if the public can demonstrate to the political leaders that they are being threatened then they are being put under the protection of the law then the courts are justified in using their powers to protect these people he said
the government has not done this before it should he said
but mr harris said he thought the evidence would lead to a wider debate about the governments approach to the problem
the evidence also could help politicians to ask themselves whether the threat of criminal prosecution is real or whether the threat of imprisonment is just a temporary measure so that people can move on then perhaps the evidence should lead politicians to consider whether there is an alternative approach which is just less likely to succeed
the evidence suggests that the blackmail and extortion of politicians is a problem but not one that is likely to be confronted in the future mr harris said
what is important is that the politicians of this country know that the threat of criminal prosecution is real and that its only temporary and that its better to take the appropriate action if there is a threat than if its permanent
if there is no alternative then who is to make the decision to go forward and jail the people who elected this government will be deprived of their very democracy

a year on and the market is growing
according to microsoft the total market for gamers worldwide is expected to be 15 billion by 2010
gamers are the next target audience according to mr doohan and he sees big opportunities for delivering such games with developers such as him
he is not a fan of the concept of letting developers create their own games and instead sees the more commercialbased model as flawed
if youre going to have an audience you have to have a strategy he said
it would be very difficult to separate the freeform form of gaming from the commercial market
microsoft has been criticised by some gamers and websites for not releasing sufficient information about how they work
the problem with the idea is its not free said ms ea web editor kurt opsahl
microsoft has not set out to solve the problem by releasing the complete set of instructions which can be downloaded from microsoft websites
instead microsoft has put them together in a document which developers call the marketing code
the document is called the ms99 guide and has links to downloadable software such as windows xp online
it lists key features of the guide such as online matches and the chance to compare the price of software with commercial ones
however developers have said the guide is too early to say a full release is in the works
microsoft said it would not be satisfied with the current state of the matter until marketing documents are made public

the handheld sports 2230 megatumbits screen and comes complete with gameboy advance software
nintendo says the software includes a networked multiplayer online feature and ability to send characters to other players online
it also includes a builtin microphone and a builtin webcam
while not quite as good as the ds it is cheaper than a comparable handheld from the same price point and with better camera control
it also comes in a more useful box with software for playing games
the price point does not seem to be a significant factor but the fact that it is a console and not an online gadget does mean it is not a serious contender to the nintendo direct system
